"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","PNC WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY !!!","Tina Blanco Carrizales","If I could give them no stars I WOULD !!! DO NOT USE PNC BANK UNLESS YOU LIKE THEM GIVIBG YOUR MONEY AWAY !!! This is the worst bank and the dumbest people work here .  They lie about transactions …. I paid a company and the money came out of my account.  But the company I paid said they declined the payment .  Which seems totally impossible because I moved money to the account just to pay a bill and to pay for services in advance because they gave me a discount.   Then the company called and said that they did release the money to them but then called me back shortly four hours later to let me know that they had reversed the charges and taking the money back from them.   But the money was still gone from my account……… PNC gave me the runaround saying that I needed to dispute the charge so that they could get the money back which they already had it back.  I talked to five or six different people and every single person gave me a different excuse and a different solution.   The money was gone from my account for over six weeks and never paid to the company that I was trying to pay.    It took about 20 hours worth of calls to finally get someone that had the money put back in my account.   Then two weeks later the money was taken out again which overdrafted my account and cost me to incur many fees…..   I even spoke to the company that they were supposed to pay and still to this day they’ve never received one penny I have since then canceled service with them and signed up with someone else.    I spoke to someone and their executive offices today and they proceeded to tell me that the money was given to the other company but we called the other company yesterday on three-way with PNC and they told him at that time that still to this day they don’t have the money from them and I’ve close the account so I no longer need to pay them.   Now I see online that PNC is giving away $400 to new customers…… and because I’m an existing customer they’re not worried about it they don’t care they don’t care that they’ve caused me to have fees and I’m probably gonna be evicted because they have kept my money and I wasn’t able to pay my rent.  Do you think these people care that they’re going to cause me to be evicted of course not !!   So unless you like your money being taken from you at any time for whatever they feel like then you should bank here but if you’d like to keep your money and pay your own bills go somewheres else.   My husband is disabled and unable to work so the little bit of money that we get plus my pay it’s just enough for us to pay our bills.   I’m sick of talking to these line people that work there they keep on pretending like the company has the money that they gave it to them and that’s a straight out lie I know this other company is trustworthy because I used to work there and that’s why it’s so embarrassing to me that this even happened","April 23, 2023","2023-07-12",NULL,NULL

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","PNC simply does not care about its customers.","Joy Nadrich","I made a simple mistake when I set up autopay for my new card in 2020.  The website seemed to be asking me for an end date with no option for ""ongoing"" so I entered a date that was two years later, thinking I would call them at some point to change it to ""forever/ongoing.""  Well, with the craziness of the pandemic for those two years, I completely forgot to find out why I had to put an end date.  My autopay ended last year and I did not realize it until a 30 day late was reported by PNC bank on my credit report.  My great credit score immediately dropped by 70+ points.  As soon as I realized what happened, I paid my account up to date and set up autopay again.  I spoke with several people at PNC and requested a goodwill removal of the 30 day late after explaining my mistake with the website autopay system, and got absolutely nowhere.      Bottom line, PNC doesn't care about its customers at all, and I would not recommend PNC products to anyone.","May 17, 2023","2023-05-18",NULL,NULL

Flat out denied. Said some nonsense about status with Experian. I don’t buy it and don’t care. They had sent me a “pre-approved” offer, I spent my valuable time signing up, and get zero return.

I am being forced to open a whole new bank account and wait 3 months or pay $3k more for a downpayment when if the bank wouldve connected it wouldve been just $1k down instead of $5K down. Then to top that off if you ever turn your debit card off through the mobile app and decide to go out with friends prepare to be left stranded with no money!

I don't use those often, but PNC started charging - a couple dollars per check! - to print them, so instead I ordered an inexpensive box from Bradford - you know, just like we did for decades before everything was online. I made sure I had ample funds in my account and gave my check to the tax collector.PNC rejected it as ""suspicious."" I called them, and they looked at it, confirmed everything was filled out correctly, the numbers were correct, everything. What could possibly be suspicious about my paying property taxes on the address printed on my check, which is also my address of record with the bank?The fact that it's a check, and not one they sold me. I wanted an assurance that they'd honor my next check when I sent another one to the tax collector, and I asked them to cover the $30 fee I incurred because of it. I didn't ask for anything else. They promised to call me back, but never did. It's been weeks now, the deadline is approaching, and I can't reach anyone at my supposedly reputable bank to confirm they'll do something as simple as honor a valid check drawn on my account. I'm out a *lot* of time going back and forth with the tax collector, an extra $30 fine plus gas, and a lot of frustration and embarrassment.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","PNC = Hard NO","Zachary Abelardo","I originally started my bank account with BBVA, which offered me a $400 bonus for starting a Checking Account with Direct Deposit. I was going to get another $50 bonus, once I started a Savings account, within six months. I also held a BBVA Compass VISA credit card, with $2000 limit. After six months, PNC acquired BBVA and informed me my Savings account did not meet the minimum balance requirements for bonus eligibility, a policy I never knew existed. PNC instructed me to destroy my existing credit card, promising a PNC credit card would replace it. Despite me asking several times about my new credit card, I was passed off to many Customer Service representatives who knew nothing, eventually I got hung up on and the new card never arrived. I still held remaining credit on the Visa card, but was unable to continue using it because I had nothing to swipe, for new purchases. I never missed payments and yet, PNC raised my existing VISA card APR from 24.99% to a whopping 31.99%, which I find is Usurious highway robbery. When I learned PNC was shutting down certain branches I realized the BBVA takeover forced them to cut costs and I was dealing with just another nickel and dime, ruthless Commercial Bank. I was finally told I needed to pay off my remaining BBVA balance first, then re-apply for a PNC Visa credit card. However, at those outrageous interest rates - I recently closed all PNC accounts and switched to a Credit Union. The staggering amount of negative reviews is no anomaly - PNC has resorted to using deceptive practices and evasion of truth, to perpetuate its existence. BBVA was a great bank, but PNC tarnished their stellar reputation, by being the polar opposite of BBVA. My best recommendation, is run far away from PNC.","June 12, 2023","2023-06-18",NULL,NULL

Some have lower fees some have higher. As ""most"" people are aware, processing times are ""mostly"" determined by the blockchain. Within the last 18mos or longer regardless of either atm my funds are ""normally"" confirmed within 30mins or less. Earlier today I purchased using Coincloud atm, I recieved a txt saying it ""will"" be confirmed in appr. 47mins. It is going on 9hrs and still no confirmation. I have spoken with Customer Service twice since.The 1st thing they will tell you ""regardless"" of your reason to call is:1. It can take up to 24hrs2. It depends on hw busy the blockchain is which is true to a certain degree.What they ""wont"" tell u is 1. Coincloud Atm machines have not been operating smoothly within the last year or so. 2. Your wait time is ""NOT"" because of the ""normal"" processing times but because of a technical glitch in there systems. Who buys bitcoin expecting it not to be processed til the nxt day? They are trained to tell you a bunch of bs that doesn't make sense. Try asking to speak to a manager or supervisor and see how far that takes you. THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SPEAK TO ANYONE IN UPPER MANAGEMENT. Which moreso pisses me off. This isnt my 1st time having UNUSUALLY LONG PROCESSING TIMES ALONG WITH HIGHER THAN NORMAL FEES but I can assure you Mr. Coincloud, it'll be my last. For those looking for LOWER fees and FAST confirmations w/o having to use a dam code try Googling COINFLIP ATMS in your area, they're in ""most"" 7/11 convenience stores and most Pittstop gas stations.Coincloud has proven to me once again that my business isn't valued. I'd rather pay a higher fee and wait 48hrs versus using a dam code because there fees are 2dam high and not owning up that their machines are not working properly.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","PNC Bank - Benchmark for the absolute worst.  Any other Mortgage Co is better.","Tom Bennett","PNC Bank is, by a considerable margin, the absolute worst financial institution I have ever dealt with.My mortgage was sold to PNC.  First, they screwed up my escrow insurance payment.  This was my first customer service experience. I came away from it kinda feeling like they were blaming me for not ensuring all info was updated.  This wasn't the first time in my life my I've had a mortgage sold, and I've never once had to contact my insurance company with new mortgage holder information.This should have been a sign of what was to come.  I updated my e-billing info with account #s and address they gave me.  Unfortunately, two weeks later they sent me billing info with same account #, but different mailing address.  First payment late.After this I started paying my mortgage monthly at beginning of month through my USAA account.  Never once has the payment posted in under 10 days. So, they never fail to give me courtesy calls at day 5.  Payments go late on the 16th and thus far I've not been late on any.After the electronic transfer took so long the first few months, I decided to mail a paper check.  Usually around 28th of month before payment is due.Guess what?  These MF'ers must have one armed illiterates handling their mail services. Again, courtesy calls start on the 5th.  Check usually clears my account by the 12th.PNC Bank sucks.  There is no way to sugar coat it.  There are problems here.","April 05, 2023","2023-04-05",NULL,NULL

I called, was told it was a standard 5 day new account hold. A week later, the hold is still there saying the same thing - call them to remove it. Not looking forward to talking to them again as obviously their phone reps don't know what the hold really was.I also set up my online profile with them. Their online banking is a mess. The site looks like it was made in 1999 and has an absolutely awful customer interface. Days after I set it up, they sent me an email asking me to to set up my online profile with them. Yeah, already did that, but followed the link anyway and as expected, they said I've already set an online profile up - lol. Then I get a message from them that I need to do things on their site to setup online (paperless) statements. I had ALREADY done that, but okay I'll try again. And again I went and it was already set up. A complete sh!t show and total waste of time.

I created a high yield savings account online. Within a week of activating the account it was completely locked I couldn't get in. I called and was transferred to so many departments just to eventually be told that I need to go in person to work this out. I went in person to a brach where they had no idea what was going on and eventually told me that my account was made online and I have to work it out over the phone because they have no control over online banking. I call the people back just to be told to go to a branch again. I tell them I did. Then I spend 5 hours the phone get transferred to the highest department(meanwhile I have yet to be told once about what is even going on). I get to the final department and they tell me ""the department I need does not exist for the online high yield savings"". They told me I will be receiving a call later on. 3 days later I get a call and they say they don't know what to do or why its closed. I then just beg them to please close my account and transfer the money back to the bank it came from. I am currently still waiting for the transfer. I received zero answers from PNC of why or any solutions on how to fix it. I have never dealt with such an unorganized company before and the savings you earn is not worth it.

You know when your love one of 20 yrs gets Stage 4 brain cancer & your account customer let's you know it was a pandemic which in order to care for my love one I lost my job.

I had to wait until their office became unswamped,employed,& open in order to clear up that matter of pay. I want you to know I gave you amazing reviews over the past 23 yrs. Recommended your bank to countless people.As for next month I WILL be banking with a bank that doesn't charge monthly service fees. When I spoke with them & had a friendly,caring, experience with their employees of staff & teller's well they will be getting amazing reviews like I use to give your bank. I know the economy with money is difficult now days but when you are having issues with other agencies denying your bank customer pay so they can pay bills & have money YOUR bank.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","PNC bait-and-switch offer","chsdi","We followed up on an offer to open a business Treasury Checking Acct, because if we maintained a $30,000 balance for 3 bank cycles we would get the $500 reward they were offering.1. It took OVER THREE HOURS to open the account, with 2 new bank reps and the manager trying to get it done.2. When we thought were were at the finish line, we were surprised by a requirement to accept a debit card. We did not want a debit card. We were told without accepting the debit card-- and using it a minimum number of times on qualifying purchases over the next 3 months-- we would not receive the $500 reward. SO-- we took the debit card.3. We were told paper statements would cost us money, so we opted for online only banking. One month later, a mysterious $3.00 charge appeared in our online statement. I called the bank rep to ask what this unexpected fee was, and she said that was the fee that went with that type of account. I asked her to show me where, in any of the website material, that was stated. She couldn't. When I pushed, she said she would have it removed. It wasn't removed.Now suspicious, I challenged the mandatory debit card and asked where THAT requirement was listed. She took a day or so and then got back to me saying there had been a ""miscommunication."" (? We have NEVER had, and said quite clearly we did not WANT a debit card, and there was a miscommunication?) I asked her to cancel the card, which she did.Next, she notified me that using the debit card had reduced our balance below the required $35,000 we had deposited... What? We had deposited more than the required thirty, and I pointed out the required minimum was $30,000, not $35,000. She said she would check on it-- then emailed me the amount was $35,000. I asked for her to direct me to the place in the PNC website that said it was 35, not 30.She stopped responding to my emails. I finally called the PNC customer support line to get this resolved. This representative said the mystery $3.00 fee was for paper statements. I pointed out we had never received a single paper statement. She immediately reversed the charge. (Why wasn't that done when the original rep said she would??)She also confirmed, multiple times and with other PNC people, that the minimum for this reward was, in fact, the $30,000--not $35,000.Won't know for sure for another 3 or 4 months whether--after all this--we actually get the ""reward"" for enduring this crappy experience. PNC withholds the reward for another 90 days after you qualified.PNC will have used our money for 8 months and between the time opening the account and the emails and calls made to correct all of the mistakes, will have sucked down over 4 hours of time. Would not have become a PNC customer had I known--not worth the $500 we MIGHT get....","May 30, 2023","2023-05-31",NULL,NULL

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Absolute worst banking experience I…","Oro Luxe","Absolute worst banking experience I have ever gone through. I opened up a business checking account to establish a relationship with PNC and from the beginning I was “red flagged”. This was later explained that the flagging came from an ACH for one of my deposits. The ACH mind you was a basic payment for products to my company. I was not able to deposit money into my account for a good two weeks while they did their due diligence. I pay for their “Pinacle” service in order to do ACH and wires and have never been able to accept or send a ACH. As of two weeks, I have been depositing money into my account with checks and cash and today again without explanation my checking account had been closed and therefore was not allowed to deposit. The manager at the branch called customer service in order to get some more information and their response was “we will send a letter of explanation to the mailing address and afterwards the client will receive a cashiers check with the funds inside of the account.” What type of bank closes accounts without any explanation or call to the customer? What type of bank finds an issue with a customer depositing money into his bank account? What type of a bank finds an issue with a customer sending and receiving money from fully verified and companies with vast history? PNC is a pitiful bank and should not be extending any service to any clients if this is how they intend to provide service.","February 27, 2023","2023-02-27",NULL,NULL

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","PNC hides and make it difficult to pay towards mortgage principle","Beverly","I closed down my checking accounts when PNC took over Compass Bank, but my mortgage is still with them. A while back I paid an extra amount towards my principle online, but looking at the account showed that they put part of that pmt towards interest. I went into the bank and the teller fixed it and applied it correctly.  Today, I wanted to make another payment towards principle and decided to save a couple steps by taking the payment to the bank. I gave the check to the teller, and as he stared at the screen he said it wasn't giving him the option to apply it to principle. He assured me that all was ok, he had called his manager to find out how to do it. He hadn't called his manager... he was typing on his keyboard.... He apparently, had ""pinged"", emailed his manager. He then pulled up a page on his computer and proceeded to read! He was having to read instructions on how to apply money to the principle on my mortgage!! He still couldn't figure it out, so he ended up calling a corporate help center and the person on the other end told him that ""all he had to do was fill out a request"" for him to be able to apply it to the principle on my account!!! He said I could make the payment online in the future.... We know where that got me the first time I tried that! So, he said he was going to do that right away and didn't need me to stay, so I hurried off to work, which I was running late for. I checked my account this evening to see that it was applied correctly, and not only did I not see if it was applied to principle, but it doesn't show up as a payment, period! It doesn't exist! I don't see it as a payment or a pending payment! Yet, the check is showing in my other bank as a cashed check!!! By the time I got to check on this, it was past hours to call and ask anyone about it. So... They don't give an tellers an option to apply a payment to principle, after asking them to look up and read how to make the transaction, it is explained that they must fill out a special ""request"" form, and then they wasted no time taking the money from my other bank checking account, but don't show this payment ANYWHERE in my PNC mortgage account, much less whether it was applied correctly, to the principle on my account!!!","May 10, 2023","2023-05-11",NULL,NULL
"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","The Worst bank in USA!","F.P.","I have been a customer of this bank for 9 years and must say it is going downfall in terms of service and customer support.They never been ideal, but for the last several years it just became one of the worst banks ever. First of all, their app is horribly buggy, it constantly under maintenance or whatever, but too often you cant even login. Second, PNC do not stand behind their customers. If you got screwed anywhere and need to do a chargeback, don’t even try, because you will be rejected. I made a purchase at convenience store and the card was declined 3 times fir unknown reason, however the charges got posted 3 days later, PNC refused to grand a chargeback request and I lost 100$. Another example, I made a purchase online and never received my order (no shipment 3 weeks after the purchase), so I tried to get a refund from vendor but my request was ghosted. I disputed transaction with PNC and again was rejected. Within 9 years I made a chargebacks 3 times and all times no help from PNC. Lastly, for me the last straw was when I found out that my account is closed by PNC. I tried to find out the reason and customer support agent told me they dont see the reason because it was handled by a different department, so representative told me to stop by to local Pnc branch. In the branch I was assisted by some very pompous and rude manager who made some stupid jokes that made me extremely uncomfortable. Anyway, this manager didn’t provide me with any information regarding why my account was closed other than saying that pnc tried to contact me prior this and that I didn’t respond, however this is not true, I never received any phone calls or letters from them. In addition he didn’t provide me with an answer why account was actually closed, because it was not shown in the system. So after that I opened account in different bank and transferred all my money from closed Pnc account there and so far my experience with new bank is so much better. I don’t recommend PNC to anyone, stay away from these incompetent and ignorant schmucks.","April 10, 2023","2023-04-20",NULL,NULL

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Trash","Robert DiBenedetto","PNC is a heaping pile of trash, what pathetic excuse for a bank. A few months ago I got a check form selling property I wished to deposit and went to my local branch, they were changing the ATM over to PNC from BBVA so I couldn't use that, the check was too large for my mobile deposit limit, so my option becomes going inside. I asked to deposit the check and they were not capable of doing it, something with the merger, he said to use the ATM. I pointed to the fact that it wasn't able to be used. I asked what we can do, given that I took time from work and my day to do this and didn't want to sit on a 50k check. Nothing, they hve no plan in place at all, even opening another account wasn't an option. He told me I could try another ATM, which I did, but that ATM did not take checks. I followed up with customer service stating how unacceptable this is. You're a bank PNC, I should be able to deposit a check without taking literal hours from my day. They gave me the address of an ATM that accepts checks, I went and guess what the ATM was not equipped to do? That's right, accept checks, I called customer service back and they could offer me an apology, nothing of substance. I opened an account with Chase and deposited there. Fast forward to yesterday, I needed to withdraw $800. My debit card was expired and I had not received a new one, so I used my wife's, but the transaction was declined, so I called in and they said it wasn't activated (lies, she withdrew a few days before) and they had me try again, failure. So now I got transferred and he said he'd need my wife, I said I'd conference her in, but no, she has to call directly, even though they'll ask security questions. He wouldn't explain why, just that it's ""policy"". Now I decide that it's time to just go ahead and get a card printed, so I go to a bank that does that, but I call first and ask ""is there any reason wouldn't be able to print a card today?"". He said no unless the machine acts up, so I make my way there. I walk in, and I'm obviously annoyed, given that so far I have had two interactions in six months with this garbage institution, to deposit a check and withdraw $800 - I was able to accomplish neither and had spent 4 to 5 hours on both. That's just plain absurdity. When I say I need a debit card printed, she asked for two forms of ID. I was not told I needed two forms when I called. So I scrambled for an insurance card, which I did not have, then she asked about the app, which I logged into, but that wasn't enough, then she asked for a credit card and said, ""see, that's all"" (naturally I was pissed. Credit cards aren't ID, but sure, take it if this will work). She also asked about my other experience and I told her it was during the merger, ""in a dismissive tone she says that was a while ago"". Okay? So did that not happen then? But later she tells me I need an attitude adjustment, but maybe the people in your building can actually properly communicate when a question is asked instead of taking the lazy way out. Then she started getting confused because I opened the account in my old home state and asked if I had my old ID. Why? Why would I carry around my old license? Is the PNC staff trained to ask incredibly stupid questions? When you have a customer in front of you that's been treated like trash by your institution for hours, don't ask stupid questions. I told her I needed $800, she eventually got me the card and I went to the drive thru ATM, guess what didn't work? Withdrawing the money. So I needed to call customer service and ask why. Now this guy sent me a pin to my phone to verify the information. Four times he asked me to repeat it and kept repeating it wrong. He finally, finally was able to comprehend the six digits, hey thanks for listening pal. He then tells me I have a $500 withdrawal limit. $500? What is this a bank for ants? I asked to increase it, citing it's my money, if I want it, I should get it, he said the max he could do is $750. So I'd need to know why the lazy worker inside decided not to tell me getting $800 would be impossible. So I walk right back to her and I'm pissed off, as I should be, because the incompetence of this bank is astounding and tell her I need to withdraw $800. She says she's working on another transaction and sends me away and some other worker, assuming manager comes (she was likely messaged on Slack, Teams, or whatever they use) because I was irate. She asked if I was trying to with draw money. ""for three hours now, yeah"" I basically told her PNC sucked. Did she help? Nah, just stood there. So I called my friend and asked if he can withdraw $800 from the bank. He said, ""of course"". So I sent him $800 and got him to do it at his bank. That's how I had to get my money from PNC. That's how I had to deposit a check.","May 21, 2023","2023-05-24",NULL,NULL

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Loyal PNC customer treated like a criminal","Chelsey Nicole","I have been a PNC customer ever since I opened a checking account. I started at PNC because my mom had an account there. Well, I was 16 at the time and I didn't realize or understand what overdraft fees were. I went to the bank and my account was in overdraft. Okay. Being 16 years old, they attempted to charge me over $170, but were ""nice"" enough to ""waive"" half of the fees. I did not receive any alerts.About 2 years ago, I opened a credit card with my mom. It was joint so that I was able to get a credit score off of it. I had an authorized transactions from at least an hour away from me. They were for various gas stations and a different areas that are nowhere close to where I live. The transactions were also on the same day when it was not possible for me to go for one place to another, especially when I work. When I called them, they jumped me from person to person to person and I was on hold for an hour. The person I talked to accused my husband of using my credit card and stealing from me. Why would my husband steal from me? He could just tell me or ask. The lady on the phone tried to argue with me and tell me that they are my transactions for they were his transactions, or even my mother-in-law stole my card. It didn't make any sense whatsoever, and those are accusations. Very big ones. She tried to tell me that you can't ""fraud"" or ""hack"" a card with a chip. How old are you? Do you live under a rock? Hackers most certainly can! Absolutely! Instead of receiving help, I and my husband get accused of fraud. How ridiculous! I have never met any company that's willing to do that to their customers, especially when I've been with them for almost 7 years now. Their alerts lag. I never received emails in time. I get an overdraft email when my account has money actually in it. Money doesn't get taken out of my bank account until days later, which makes me think I have more money than what I actually have. Honestly, sometimes I feel like they take my money because it goes in mysterious ways. When I am overdraft, they will tell me I have a negative balance at 2:00 a.m. . Who's up that early? Who's going to check their bank account? Then they tell you if you don't put your balance above zero in 12 hours or less, they'll start charging you at least $30. It doesn't necessarily make sense to charge someone money when they don't have money at all, doesn't it? Get your act together. Don't trust PNC. I don't trust PNC. They're a scam. I'm 100% switching to Suncoast.","April 12, 2023","2023-04-13",NULL,NULL
"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","PNC no longer has a functioning Customer Service","Randall J","If zero stars was a choice I would have clicked that. I have been a customer of PNC and its legacy banks for nearly 50 years.  I started with Northeastern Bank of Pennsylvania in1974 as a USAF cadet in Colorado Springs.  The bank took a risk on me and gave me a car loan which I paid back.  Up until now, I have enjoyed and valued the remote relationship I have maintained with PNC Bank over this five decade period of time.  I lived overseas twice during my career and moved all around the US. I never once set foot inside a PNC bank simply because there was never one near where I lived. I now live in Lynn Haven Florida.  There is no local PNC Branch in Lynn Haven.  The nearest PNC Branch is in Destin Florida.I will present the two reasons I am terminating my 50 year relationship with PNC Bank.  The first matter concerns PNC’s current policy with respect to opening a CD.  In February of this year I decided to investigate CD Rates and came to the conclusion it was time to take some money from my checking account and move it into a CD.  I quickly learned that this needed to be done in person at a PNC branch.  I decided to try and learn why this was the case since in the past and during COVID it was possible to do this over the phone.  My inquiry comprised multiple calls to 800-233-4171, multiple conversations with consultants in the sales department, one person in Birmingham Al to whom my complaint had been elevated, two branch managers, and finally a Vice President for Executive Client Relations in Michigan.  I spent the better part of two weeks investigating this and to try to find a work around.  The conversations with the two branch managers are worth noting. One was in Destin Florida. It became clear that, in her case, my problem was not her problem.  She very quickly routed me back to customer service stating the over the phone “system” was down. A second branch manager in the Tampa area took ownership of my problem and proposed an “out of the box” solution.  His approach was to offer me a special saving account rate commensurate with current CD rates (say in the 3.5% to 4% range).  I complement this individual since he, unlike his Destin counterpart, demonstrated he was willing to work the issue. I will also say that two sales consultants, who were willing to speak candidly, did admit that they too were frustrated with this situation. One admitted sales was how she made her living and if she could not sell a product it hurt where it counts - in her pocket book. At several junctures I asked the PNC employees I spoke with how they would handle a US service member deployed overseas. One sales consultant triumphantly responded that he or she would have to fly back to the states to open a CD!! That is outrageous!! I am suspicious of the statement that PNC is “working on the system” to allow an over the phone opening of a CD.  They have been working on it for several months – at least since the first of this year. -A large bank such as PNC should have a very flexible and agile IT department and any IT “fixes” should be rolled out quickly. I believe the policy is in response to some nefarious incident.  Most institutions react to bad news situations by quickly shutting down the “thing” where the problem occurred.  The most frustrating aspect to this matter is no one knows why this policy was put in place and if or when it will be changed.  For whatever reason, the information is being tightly controlled.I also don’t believe this policy came from the top. I want to believe the CEO – Mr. William Demchak – did not direct this and that he is probably not even aware of this issue.My second reason for leaving is I find PNC’s interest rates on deposit accounts to be predatory in nature.  I cite the example of my checking account which currently pays .01%.  PNC Customer Service reps cite this as the ""industry standard.""  The new bank to which I am moving pays 25 times that amount on a checking account.  When I pointed this out to one PNC sales rep, I was lectured that checking accounts are not intended to be investment vehicles. Of course they are not!   Meanwhile PNC is busy loaning funds I have deposited and paying an insulting rate of .01%.  The PNC sales reps I spoke with are too young to know that in the past PNC did pay higher rates on checking deposits. I checked again yesterday ( 6 April) by calling customer service.  The phone system for opening a CD is still down.  This makes no sense. I no longer recommend PNC. When I read the reviews from this site (around 700!) it all rings true.The bank has lost the bubble on customer service. Too big and too cumbersome.  Take your money out of PNC Bank and run away as fast as you can. Randall J","April 06, 2023","2023-04-07",NULL,NULL

I’m sure I paid thousands of dollars in fees to PNC in my early 20s when I had a good job but was young and dumb with money. Their overdraft fees are legit and they continuously charge you 35 dollars every day you’re over. It’s seriously scary how much money you can end up giving to PNC just by over drafting a few days before your next paycheck. Not cool and now I am with chime and the difference in money management with them is so much better. Also their saving account has a higher yield percentage than PNC. Obviously PNC operating their many business offices and employees leads to hefty fees for their customers. That is why I switched to chime and I do not miss having an actually bank building to go to.

I called customer care on both occasions and they were unable to explain why my card declined stating fraud prevention may have suspended the card for usual activity. I was very embarrassed by the entire situation on both occasions not being able to make my purchase and having other customers witness this difficulty.  As a long-time customer transitioning from Compass/BBVA to PNC I did not feel valued or that I had a competent team to resolve my issue. I decided it was time to allow another institution to handle most of my banking transactions.  I visited your local branch in Pelham, Al to cancel my account and transfer some funds to the new bank. The agent reviewed my account and saw my efforts to resolve the issue and stated it appears it was not the bank it was the merchant. PNC did not take the appropriate actions and I did not feel like my business was important. The new bank identified my PNC debit card chip was causing the error and I only needed a new debit card. Because I had some pending transaction and would not be able to complete my bank change until next week I went back to PNC for a new debit card. I was informed they do not provide onsite debit card and the branch that do did not have any on hand. I was offered the option to order one that will take three weeks. On the other hand the new bank provided me a debit card the same day. Do PNC have the staff employed that can provide the customer service needed to retain customers and to resolve simple issues. I am in customer service and find this level of service unacceptable.

I have never dealt with a more unprofessional, inconsiderate and unknowledgeable person with ANY company as I did her! I lost $500 in fraudulent charges through PNC Bank on my company prepaid debit card which I received through my employer for my paycheck. Through the last 4 months I have been trying to get the money reimbursed to my account yet the company still will not comply. I filed fraud charges one day after they hit my account when I noticed. I filed a police report to press charges on the individual responsible. I ended up filing with the government agency in hopes of recovering my money that was stolen. That was the money I saved to pay for a surgery I still need and it was stolen off my bank card while still in my possession. How was it handled?  With an accusatory under informed so-called professional customer care specialist that's denied me a refund even after being reminded the company policy states otherwise!  She has twice now emailed to inform me she has closed my case even while I am currently in discussion with the company's card services team!  It has been 4 months of dealing with a nightmare with police and finances, and this PNC employee has made everything much harder with her negligence and inconsiderate responses to my questions. What started as Mr being appreciative that my company chose a bank that was able to help in aatter like this has now turned into me seeking legal help to protect myself in order to get reimbursed for my original amount. All I wanted was my money back. This is still going on.  3 months later. I wanted what any other bank would have provided me by law. Coverage in case something bad happen.

We are an established African American middle/working class couple with good credit and low debt. Our experience with PNC from start to finish was an EXTREME stressful experience! A process that should have taken 30 days to finish ended up taking over 90 days because PNC was so sloppy and extremely untimely in processing our application. Our assigned representative was always out of the office and very difficult to contact; Our paperwork/contract was riddled with errors and each time one was discovered, it took weeks for PNC to correct; Repeated request for information that should had be cleared early in the application process; And finally, it took 2 scheduled closing dates where we had to arrange time away from work and other obligations to attend. After closing on that 2nd., scheduled closing date, past 90 days, when we got our first bill, we discovered one of the errors that was ""supposed"" to be corrected, and we signed off on as a corrected item, was not corrected. We got so many apologies from PNC representatives along the way and afterward; Including bank manager Ingra Gelishvilli, Roxoboro Rd location in Durham NC, suggesting and promising to submit a request to her manager for approval for a gift/token to us as a result of our inconvenience and PNC's neglect.

They seem not to understand that it's important to be able to know what your balance is so that you are where of when you may need to make a deposit to cover something unexpected. The first time, they were willing to refund the fees (about a year ago), but not the second time around. As it was explained to me, transactions that caused my account to be overdrawn WERE and still ARE pending, but the deposits I made that is also pending but also made available right away, but didn't somehow cover the transactions; therefore, the overdraft fees are justified.

Sat second car in drive thru for at least 10 minutes without moving. so decided to go inside lobby.  Had a check made out to me AND my wife, signed by both of use to cash for 3-figures.  The clerk ""assessed"" that signature for a good 5 minutes, then once it ""passed"" she asked the other teller if she was allowed to cash it without my wife present.  She has been with the branch for at least 30 days... and is horribly undertrained on all duties from what I've seen on this and prior visit.  She was NOT the problem however.  The problem was the person ""working"" the drive thru.  He interjected with attitude to her and to the customer (myself) and basically has also not been trained in proper customer service.  I have been with this branch through probably 3 mergers, name changes, etc.... for the last 25+/- years.  He is also somewhat new (at least at this branch).  While he was mouthing off to me and the clerk, the drive thru buzzer sounded for the client there to ask if ""everything okay in there ??  It's been a while"".  He responded how he was the only one in drive thru... and then went back to trying to argue with me about the situation.  When I FINALLY left the bank (with my money), the SAME car that had been in front of me was sitting in the drive thru waiting for money.  I went promptly to the very next bank down the street (Atlantic Union) and opened an account within about 10 minutes -- while seeing 7 customers helped between the drive thru and the inside tellers at that location.  I will test-drive Atlantic Union for a few months but am CERTAIN that PNC will soon be a distant memory for my family.  They have been a pain since before the Pandemic started, got WAY worse, and don't even see a way to recover on the horizon.","December 28, 2022","2022-12-29",NULL,NULL

I recently sent on 11/28/22 a wire transfer to Madrid Spain to family/friend because they working on a major deal, my friends given me the accts prior before so when I send off the fund I was not paying attention that I used the old acct that I had before. When I noticed the error on my part I immediately reached out to PNC and told them. They said it's fine it will bounce back. Because a week past and it didn't bounce back I told them to just recalled it back, I guess they didn't want to do there jobs,I been sending money internationally a long time, apparently PNC only want you to do sending locally. Right after I asked for the recall they closed all my accounts with no prior notice. Up to this day on 12/26/22 I haven't received my money back!! PNC buy out BBVA here in the United States.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","They seriously need to learn to better communicate.","Will Smith","On the banking app There was a pending deduction for a payment to a chase credit card.I have never had any account with Chase, so I contacted customer service and was told nothing could be done until it was actually posted. So the next day it was posted for $420 and left me with an overdraft. Contacted the bank and the basically told me to 1. File a dispute and 2. Go to my local branch to get a new account number. So looked online and the fraudulent transaction wasn't even listed. Call the bank again and they filed a dispute at their end. At that point that transaction actually was listed online, however my account was now in the negative. I complained again that that meant when my paycheck was direct deposited It would all be taken to pay for the overdraft! Again was told their was nothing they could do until it went through. Next day my paycheck went through and as I expected was not enough to completely cover the overdraft so account was still in the red. I did go up to the local branch and tried to at least get a new account number. And was told I had to open a new account. Needed $25 to do so. I don't have $25. My account is I'm the negative and I had no cash. I am disabled so don't earn much at all.instead the put a hold on my account so no money could be taken out. Ok, fine but I told them I am disabled and need my money to pay for an important prescription. They gave me a # to call. Who could help me getting emergency credit. I did. Was told they would review and make a decision within 48 hours. That was all on Friday. It I'ts now Monday and nothing has changed. To resolve the dispute will take 10 business days, so here I am. No money, no medicine and my electricity will be turned off soon. So guess I'll just die here, just a question of how. Freeze to death in the dark? Die because I can't pay for insulin. Maybe just starve!  What I really don't get in all of this is why the hell they even post ""pending"" transactions if there's no way to do anything about them.I realize the fraud isn't PNCs fault. Someone stole my account number and used my account to pay their credit card bill. So why couldn't I dispute it before it went through and at least prevent my paycheck from being taken up by the overdraft. Even if I got some cash put in I can't touch it now until I get a new #. And then I have to find a ride to the bank to get that done. This all happened over a weekend just before a major holiday. What am I supposed to do! So 1. Why wasn't able to stop the fraud before it happened? Could have at least stopped my paycheck from being taken like it was 2. Why did they tell me to get a new # without telling me it would mean opening a new account which would require cash? 3. Why hasn't anything been done to at least get me the emergency credit? If I actually survive the next couple of weeks I will be changing banks.","December 16, 2022","2022-12-19",NULL,NULL

However, having gone to an office, my relative's name now appears under my own, as if she's a co-owner. She's not.

Came from BBVA and never had a problem with them then they were bought out by PNC and that's when the problems started. First it took me 3 weeks to get my bank card. That should have been my first clue. After that I started to notice transactions I made would randomly appear and disappear from my acct. I only have this account for daily expenditures (gas, food etc...) so I like to know exactly how much money I have in this acct at any given time. Because of this problem I cannot rely on the banking app. Example... Sunday I have $1000 in my acct and I use my card 4/5 times Monday and Tues and when I use the card the money is deducted from the acct. then on Wednesday 2,3,4 or all 5 will be removed from my acct like they were never there and money put back. They will be gone for 2/3 sometimes 4 days then just reappear. It's almost like they purposely do this to try and get you to overdraft. Until I switched banks I had to dig out an old bank book I had to physically write and calculate every time I swiped my card. What's the purpose of a banking app if its not current.  I talked to pnc numerous times about this issue and they swore they do not remove transactions. They said the merchant does it??? Kinda odd the same merchants didn't do this when I had BBVA. Not only that the app is down without warning more times than it should be and always at the most inconvenient times. I put up with this nonsense way longer than I should have.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Froze my account, no explanation, refused to unfreeze for hours. Cost me money, time, embarrassment and stress.","Chuck","Without warning, PNC froze my checking account. I had over $950 in accessible funds. I had deposited a $400 + check, and $960 cash the day previously. I had rented a uhaul truck to buy heavy construction supplies from a store. Took a day off from work, spent close to $200 on the uhaul truck.After several hours of picking out building supplies, I drag approximately 1000 pounds of building materials all the way from the rear warehouse, through the entire store. With 1000 pounds on a dolly, it was difficult. After waiting in line, I go through the process of checking out. My card comes up declined. Mind you, I put close to $1500 in the day previous. I try again. And again. Declined three times. Now, I’m embarrassed, there’s a bunch of people in line. I check my account balance for my primary virtual wallet PNC checking account. It reads $958 of accessible funds. I am purchasing $508 of merchandise, so what is the issue?I contact PNC. first guy disconnects the call unexpectedly. Maybe it’s bad reception? I call again. Menu prompts, finally get to PNC employee. I explain the situation. I have 1000 pounds of building material, my card is declining at checkout, I need help so I can complete the transaction.I am put on hold two times. Finally the PNC employee informs me that there is a freeze on my card and I need to talk to a specific department to unfreeze it. The employee that informs me that the current wait time is 60 to 90 minutes. I reiterate that I am in the front of a line with 1000 pounds of construction material. IThe employee gives a fake canned insincere apology, saying I would need to wait for someone else to lift the restriction PNC imposed.No one had contacted me or informed me of any reason for freezing my account. No emails, text, phone calls. Without any warning, PNC froze my account.I had been trying to be patient, but the lack of empathy or consideration for the grief PNC was causing me unnecessarily sent me over the edge. I informed the staff this situation was bs, that they were playing games with my money. I am a grown man trying to utilize the money that I earned and deposited into their bank.No empathy for the stress, embarrassment, frustration or financial losses this situation was causing me. the PNC employee ignored my grievances and complained about me swearing and having an attitude.Yeah, I’m gonna have an attitude when you freeze my funds, don’t contact me, don’t explain why, and refuse to address and correct the issue.The employee was being antagonistic. I explain how this situation is causing me tremendous grief, the PNC employee responds with “I’m sorry YOU feel that way.” …passive aggressive BS.The PNC employee then informed me that she would be discontinuing the call because of my swearing and disrespectful behavior. I didn’t start off swearing or disrespectful… Then the PNC employee hung up on me. I then waited on hold for nearly 2 hours, for someone who “could assist me”. The freeze was lifted pretty quickly, and the explanation provided was bs. They claimed my chip on debit card was acting up (sometimes not reading), so they assumed my card was fraudulent and locked my account. I’ve had this account for over 8 years, nearly 9 years. They didn’t reach out, just froze my account.PNC created an unnecessary problem by freezing my account. By the time they finally unfroze my account, the store had returned all the merchandise to their original stock locations. I had spent several hours gathering the stuff and labored to bring the material to the front of the store.Not only was my energy and time wasted, the poor store employees had to spend time and energy restocking 1000 pounds of construction material.By the time the “issue” (ie the bs drama PNC created) was “resolved” (ie - they finally stopped playing games with MY money); the store was about to close, my merchandise was gone, I lost a day I took off from work for, and my uhaul rental would need to be repeated. PNC played games with my money, prevented me from completing my business, and cost me nearly $200 in needing another uhaul rental, and another day to do something that would’ve otherwise been completed today.I lost money, time, and suffered unnecessary stress, anger and embrassment…because PNC decided to play games with my money.","November 23, 2022","2022-11-24",NULL,NULL

Lisa DeFilippo, the branch sales and service representative drew the process out for a month, did not follow up on document submissions, and gave incorrect information regarding the process. I was told to return with Surrogate/ Executor paperwork so that the custodial savings account could be transferred to my name and that then I could do whatever I wanted with the account. After calling three times and returning a third time, I was informed that checks would be issued in the minor’s name for $100 and a now adult child’s name for $15- yes, minimal amounts.All bank representatives should be well versed in the process and courteously guide estate executives through the process. Customers should not have to return multiple times and contact the bank and branch manager for assistance. George Maloney, the branch manager was unable to assist in Lisa’s absence and refused to honor the process of transferring ownership to the executor as outlined by his bank representative. He also refused to disclose contact details for the legal department to verify the account closure process. PNC Bank should ensure that its representatives are informative, transparent, accountable and offer expeditious support to customers. Multiple patrons of color attempting to close out accounts or transfer ownership of accounts experienced insensitive service at this branch. Cultural sensitivity training would definitely benefit the employees in charge of assisting customers at the West Grove branch.

My only purpose was to take the pressure off my shoulders and work with more peace of mind and,honestly, paying $460 a month for someone with an annual income of $90k is not a very difficult task, I definitely do not recommend this bank !!!!Fabio Cardoso.","October 08, 2022","2022-10-08",NULL,NULL

I am quite livid with the degradation of quality of service and ability to execute, especially with their Pinnacle system.A perfect example, and one of many, would be my request to close the pinnacle account.I requested to have it closed 3 weeks ago. I had not heard back from anyone for 2 weeks, so I reached out to (1) ensure the process is being executed and (2) that I would not be charged for the following month's pinnacle system. I was asked to send an email to the individual processing the request last week. Today I find a $163.50 charge for the pinnacle system. Naturally I called the business support at which point the rep confirmed that I should not have been charged but gives me yet another email address to write requesting resolution for the charge.Its a shame because it was a great bank until last year.My accountant suspects PNC is under water and using customer funds to cover their cash flow. At first I thought it was a silly idea but with each interaction I am more convinced she is right. I do hope FRB, FDIC and SEC are going to look into PNC's practices. It seems that they are the BoA of 2022. Fast forward to today,","October 03, 2022","2022-10-04",NULL,NULL

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","You’ll only hear from them when they’re…","Doug Rosenberger","You’ll only hear from them when they’re selling you something. If you have a problem you’re on your own. I’ve been banking here since 2014. The virtual wallet account/features are fine, but the web based online banking and mobile app lag way behind their competitors and any time I’ve had an issue, their customer support has been nothing more or less than a shoulder to cry on. A few years back they decided to start blocking my acorns investment account round ups from being withdrawn from my checking account. I tried several times to address the issue with customer service but they were no help. Earlier this year I took out an auto loan to buy out my car lease. Honda requires a federal odometer statement to be completed and signed to release the title. PNC should know this, but when I presented that signed paper during my loan appointment I was told it wasn’t needed. I told the loan officer I was certain it was needed and asked that it be included with the check. Fast forward several weeks, PNC title department is blowing up my phone because they haven’t received the title. Meanwhile I’m getting letters from Honda that they haven’t received the  federal odometer statement. It took over a month of PNC calling me (the middle man) about their issue with Honda and the title. Then when Honda finally releases the title, I do the transfer at the NC DMV and I think I’m done. NOPE. A few weeks go by and I get a letter from the DMV stating that PNC is not compliant with an electronic lien holder law enacted in North Carolina in 2016. I’m informed the state will be holding my car title until the issue is resolved. At this time I was buying and remodeling a house so I let it go for a month or so and finally called PNC to inform them of the issue. Spent an hour plus on the phone with customer service. Read the letter several times to the agent who clearly didn’t understand what was I was talking about. They wouldn’t let me talk to the title department because they apparently only make outbound calls. Customer service finally suggested I send a FAX to their title department requesting a call back (stating they also “don’t have email”). So this resourceful millennial figured out how to send them a fax without a land line, without a fax machine but naturally I never heard back from them. After 6 months they finally resolved the issue with the state. As soon as I have a bit of free time I’m transferring all my accounts away from this helpless bank.","August 15, 2022","2022-10-02",NULL,NULL

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Bad HELOC Experience","Scott LAMASTER","My wife and I were working with PNC on a HELOC loan. We both have 740 or higher credit with a dept to income ratio of under 50 and good income, we also invested over 120k in the property over the past 12 months. We started the process on 7/15/2022 and finally decided to use a different lender on 9/08/2022. The reason is because PNC used a drive by appraiser that undervalued our property by at least 115k. When we brought this to PNC’s attention and provided receipts and documentation, it was like pulling teeth to have them set up a new appraisal. When they finally did, it was the same appraisal company, but this time they came into our house. Two weeks later the new appraisal came in 20k less than their 1st appraisal. THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE SINCE WE HAD JUST INVESTED 120k. PNC did not want to loan us what we were requesting so we reached out to another lender, and we are already set to close on 9/22/22. The new lenders appraisal came in at 115k over what PNC had. They were so disturbed by the other appraisal company’s incompetence, that they decided to file a complaint. It took PNC almost 3 months to process a basic HELOC loan with good credit and income, as our new lender completed the process in about 3 weeks. I will never use PNC again!","September 06, 2022","2022-09-18",NULL,NULL

You may be told that everything is going well by your loan officer and start paying for things and even have to provide more documents and information, just to make the underwriter happy, even though you provided the information already or who they may need to contact to verify, the Underwriter will decide will on what they want to accept or spend time to verify and will not communicate with the loan officer. We missed our deadline dealing with PNC and their underwriter not accepting a non taxable documented employment with years of documentation. We paid for the appraisal and other needed things a week before the deadline and our loan officer could not get the underwriter to update them on anything causing for their boss to get involved until our loan officer told us that we need to go look elsewhere because the underwriter wasn't going to approve us, even though his boss said all our information and documentation was good. Our loan officer was told prior to us paying for the appraisal that our file was good to go by the Underwriter but a week later, no communication until a few days after the deadline has passed. When brought to PNC about their failures on how this was handled, and requesting compensation for the appraisal, PNC saw not issues with what occurred after doing a ""lengthy"" investigation and refused the request. Getting denied for a loan is part of the game, but lack of communication, being told inconsistent information and even being told by the company's loan officer to go look at another company and apologizing for how the Underwriter handled our file, are all red flags as to why you should not use PNC for a mortgage loan.","July 01, 2022","2022-09-12",NULL,NULL

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","What I'm about to tell you is","Al","What I'm about to tell you is , to be quite frank, unbelievable. I don't blame you for casting doubt on my story but I assure you it is all true and verifiable because the branch called the police and I'm sure there is a record. As I write this it is Sunday afternoon. I am sitting in what is my new lodgings which happens to be a blue port a potty on an abandoned job site. It is raining. I have not eaten since noon Friday. My water ran out last night. When my truck was impounded they allowed me to get what I could carry but nothing could be left on the side of the road so all my possessions left as well. I am 1,000 miles from home. I was a normal , responsible person with employment and I considered myself an asset to society as a whole. That all changed at 5:30pm Friday afternoon at a PNC branch near Cincinnati when I put my ATM card in their machine which promptly confiscated it. I went inside to inform them of the problem to which their answer was ""Call your bank"". They informed me that although the ATM is on their property, has their logo on it and they do business with it that they don't own or have any control over it. My bank will not mail a new card to me because my residence at the time was a hotel as I was out of my area working. At this point PNC bank had left me destitute. You had taken the only access to my finances. Saturday after opening I went back to the branch to seek help. My rent was due. I was low on fuel and had not eaten in almost 24 hours.( At 48 hours the pains seem to subside but the longings for food does not) I had found a checkbook and re-entered the branch, after talking to my bank who gave me several options , I was pleading for help. I was adamant about presenting solutions to the scenario which came about as soon as your ATM took my card. I offered several solutions but was rejected to the offer! At this point I could tell they were done with me and that's when the police arrived. To shorten this story , mainly to conserve battery , let's jump to Saturday night. Since I could not pay room rent I packed my belongings in my truck and tried to get to my jobsite but ran out of fuel before I got there. Last night when the police arrived to investigate why I was there . I told them the story so far and that I was out of fuel and waiting on tomorrow to try to seek a remedy as I was now destitute and homeless because of PNC bank. I don't think they believed my story. Why shoud they? It sounds like a made up sob story and I am going thru it.  I don't think whoever reads this can ever fully understand or appreciate the shame of being penniless and homeless with no options. Where at every point help was available but refused solely because when we normal people see a begger or homeless we think I did it why can't they? What's wrong with them for being poor?I've been broke and homeless for a day now and I tear up at my attitude towards the less fortunate. I understand the shame of having nothing. I see the look in people's eye when they regard me. Asking for help, Telling a wild story of how ""Really, it's not my fault. I have money I just can't get to it right now"". I will thank PNC bank for one thing. You have opened my eyes to how close we ALL are to reverting to our animal instincts.  I will be drinking river water soon.I have not gone thru the dumpster yet but I fear it is in my future. I'm mainly hopping to find shelter material but some canned goods would be welcomed. I can bash it on the rock and drink whats inside if I find something.  Have you ever thought about how to open a can without an opener? I have.It's Sunday now. I hope to have better living arrangements by tonight because you can't really sleep sitting up in a port a potty I've found . At best you get a few naps in. So here we are ....     I'm broke,homelss, no vehicleHungry and hiding out like a criminal on old job site  I have no way of accessing g my funds. I was refused all help at the branch then you called the police to tell me I can't even sit in your lot while I figure this out  You have ruined my life. You have stolen my access to life's necessities with no apology or compassion. I have money. I have checks. In today's world I cannot believe such a simple thing has cost me so much. You had the chance to remedy the situation instead you chose to distance yourself from your responsibilities. Your actions have left me in a situation I may not survive all because your machine ate my card. What small things turn the wheel of life against you instead of for you.Monday...Daylight If you think you won't kill to survive,  your wrong. When faced with starvation the human animal will go to very drastic measures to continue life.5hats all it is. The single , sole very basic need to eat takes over. You don't think 'will it be missed?'does it have a family? The hunter comes out. The wind takes on a thickness you have never felt before. The snap of a twig sounds like a gunshot.

Out of all of the pages that show every transaction that has been made we were only able to get three pages that showed the actual percentage. Lucy the branch manager has tried to get corporate to get this information to us so we could get this resolved but has had no luck. Corporate did call me the day before yesterday and left a voicemail. I tried returning Angela‘s phone number I left a message I did not receive a return call I called approximately an hour and a half later and still have not received a return phone call from her.  Phone call again with no answer. I pay my statement balance every month, which is my actual balance now because I do not carry over a balance from previous months. I Went yesterday and paid off the balance, at the PNC branch on Jefferson as it was going to be due on the 20th and I did not want to take a chance of this dragging on to where for some reason the payment wouldn’t be able to be made on time. What I thought was going to be a situation that Could get solved fairly quickly, especially after meeting Lucy face-to-face as she is the branch manager, and  Angela from corporate. For some reason, we could not get the documents we needed to go over and see where mistakes have been made, one way or the other. After waiting three more days with no appointments, no explanations. I went yesterday and paid the balance on my account off $1471.25 .I will be adding this to my original complaint, as I don’t feel this will ever get resolved.Draw your own conclusion, that if I was an individual that had hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank or even millions, would it have taken over three weeks to get this resolved? I think not.In closing I would like to acknowledge that Lucy the branch manager has always been polite and professional with me and I felt she wanted to get it resolved as much as I did. I only talk to Angela twice she assured me that they were going to take care of this and that they were on it, but nothing ever got done.Maybe after reading this you can make your own decision about doing business with this lending institution.","August 19, 2022","2022-08-19",NULL,NULL

"PNC Bank","2 out of 5","Rude Customer Service","Antigone","I just finished speaking with customer service at PNC. I was a BBVA customer and since PNC took over I have not had a reason to speak with anyone. I called online banking and was transferred  to customer service. The young woman I was talking with about enrolling in online banking was rude. I did not have a pin for my card I had had the account for 10 years but had never used the pin. Also,  I did not have an ID pin given to me when I setup the account because I never setup an account with PNC. I answered many questions to show that the account that I wanted to enroll in online banking was mine. I was eventually informed that I would need one of those pins to enroll in online banking. However, the customer  service persons voice was getting louder and had a negative tone. She could have just said initially "" I'm sorry but I will not be able to enroll you in online banking today the card pin is required. I can send you one in the mail which you should receive in 3-5 days. She sounded annoyed that I did not have a card pin, did not have an ID pin and that I was not aware of those facts. She had asked earlier on if I wanted a pin and I said no I just want to enroll in online banking. I did not know that I had to have a card pin to enroll in online banking. I have only ever used a card pin for cash withdrawals which I have not done in the last 25 years. Also, I have had many online banking accounts and if you can provide enough information customer service has always been able to help.  I have never had to have a card pin to enroll in online banking. I was already enrolled in online banking through BBVA and the account was about 9-10 years old. So maybe using a pin is a good idea, but pardon me for not knowing that  it was required. I have been asked many questions over the years but never have I had to have a card pin. When I told the customer  service agent that she had an unpleasant attitude she was even more unpleasant. I can only imagine my distress if had I been calling about a serious banking concern. I told her that I had been a customer at BBVA. My first experience with PNC was today, a bank that I had never even heard of until they took over BBVA. What an unpleasant first and probably last experience.","August 15, 2022","2022-08-15",NULL,NULL

I tried calling, but the voice banking wouldn’t work and there doesn’t seem to be another way to get through. I tried messaging, but the webpage would crash every time I tried. Finally, I went to a PNC branch to solve the issue and the manager was incredibly rude. He talked down to me the whole time and basically insisted I was lying, until I showed him my bank app with the multiple transactions. He then said there was nothing PNC could do.

"PNC Bank","2 out of 5","PNC corporate cares more about the money than about the customer","Dave B","PNC bank as a company are pretty lousy. I opened an account when I moved to Georgia in 2015. The Palmetto branch is well run, but PNC corporate has many drawbacks. I had my account go negative a few years ago when my wife died and a month later Social Security debited her last benefit check back... typical government. The local branch worked it out with me but otherwise I would have been hit with fees for 4 days (PNC charges, or used to charge, a recurring fee for the first 4 days your account is negative whether any new transactions have gone through or not.) Second, I tried to get my house refinanced to fix my septic tank and PNC was there for every step, calls each day to update me until they decided that they would not do the refinancing. One day I stopped hearing from them until I got the form letter a week and a half later that they would not be doing the refinancing... basically they talked to me until they decided that they would not do my refinancing (and get the interest payments for it) and then I was not worth talking to or emailing. The final straw was this spring. I had a house in another state that I finally got to sell. I needed a form notarized since it was a cash sale. I went into the local branch (they have a notary, I know because I had called) to get it notarized and was told that they only notarize real estate that is done through PNC. So I had to find another notary and pay to get it done even though I had been a PNC customer for years and had never missed any payments to anybody or bounced any checks. Again, the local branch is great but PNC corporate seems to me to be all about makibg the money and, in a choice between making some more money and customer service, the customer will always lose.","August 11, 2022","2022-08-11",NULL,NULL

I’ve been with this bank for years now and I honestly don’t know why because my family and I have had nothing but problems and gone into financial issues because of them. I’ve had one helpful lady who spoke clear English in all the countless times I’ve called to speak to their customer service. They have other nice people that work there but I don’t know if they realize I just nod along to things they say because I can’t understand them. I think they do it that way to lower the number of calls made to their CS dept. but it would still be nice to not have to be on the phone for an hour because I need everything repeated. But even after calling them three times over the last two weeks, I still don’t have a debit card. They told me it would arrive in the mail earlier this week, and it’s now the weekend and I was told by another PNC member just this morning that the order for my new debit card is nonexistent. I’ve been without a means to pay for anything for like three weeks now. The money in my old checking account was hacked into and stolen. I know better than to use debit cards now, but having one just in case would be nice. I was told my social security number is wrong by several PNC members. I can’t send money through Zelle either right now because my ATM pin does not work. I can’t use my bank account in Venmo because I have no means of verifying my account. And of course banks are only open like 3 days a year so I have to wait another while before going in for more help. I actually just got a Discover card for the time being so I can afford to eat and have a roof over my head. Oh and don’t get me started on PNC randomly cancelling access to all my accounts for no reason. That’s a fun one. And the worst part is, this happens ALL the time. I’m so lost with this bank, I don’t know why it’s so bad and I know it’s sort of known to be the “bad bank” too.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","PNC Bank Is Bad","Dorothea L","PNC Bank Arlington, Texas.  The worst banking experience EVER--froze me out of my account for a week without any notice to me--leaving me scrambling to pay my rent that I had scheduled to be paid through my PNC Account.  I am NOT talking about a check hold.  This money had been in my account for a month and a half.  They still have not returned all my money.  I opened a new account with PNC Bank in June 2022 after I moved to a different area, with a cashier's check and two $100 money orders.  They could not be bothered to call the issuing bank for the check until the next day.  And made a big stupid deal about whether I could open a new account with a cashier's check.  ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?  The check was cleared the next day, but they put an extended hold on the $100 money orders--which I thought was crazy.  They had been fooled by a money order before they said.  I thought that was the point of using a money order that it is as good as cash-apparently not.  But the real crazy was yet to come.  I made additional deposits over the next month.On Sunday, July 31 paid my rent online with my PNC account.  On Monday, August 1, 2022, I got a low balance email alert from my PNC Bank account. I looked on my account and it showed I had money but said $0 ""available"" balance.  I called CS and she (dumb) said the bank had decided ""they did not want a relationship with me"", but would send me my money in TWO WEEKS by mailing me a cashier's check for my money.  What about the rent that's due now?  I asked for her supervisor (dumber).  He didn't know anything.  He gave me apparently the wrong phone number to ""account closure"". I called ""account closure"" and their answering machine said it was the ""check fraud"" department and if I left a message they were not the right department they would not call back.  What you cannot bother to call a customer back to re-direct my call?  Apparently not b/c they never called me back.  I called and emailed the Arlington, TX PNC Branch repeatedly.  The woman who I spoke with, Betty, had set up my account in the first place.  I told her I wanted my money NOW.  She lied and said they had already mailed the casher's check to me.  I asked by certified mail?  She didn't know.  She told me her manager's name, Adrian and he would call me back.  But he didn't call me that day.  I asked her for the manager's manager/director's number.  She refused to give it to me.  She said I had to go through channels. I told her for that to work the manager had to call me back.  In the meantime I'm scrambling to pay my bills and rent with no access to my funds, after incurring a NSF fee when PNC Bank did not honor my rent payment and I incurred a $42 FedEx fee to overnight a rent check from another account to the leasing office.  I spoke with PNC Branch Manager Adrian on Wednesday or Thursday  and he was going to look into it.  Crickets.  On Friday we spoke and he said I could come pick up a cashier's check for my money.  He didn't say what changed or why I couldn't get my money from Monday to Friday up to that point, despite my repeated demands, and now I could.  What happened?   He said that PNC had probably sent me a letter explaining.  I told him NO, PNC Bank hadn't sent me ANYTHING and the only way I knew they had frozen my account was a low balance alert I had set up.  Adrian said they were holding $1,000 for a mobile deposit I had made on July 11.  I asked why, he said they were holding it for 5 business days.

I walk into the bank Friday to get my check and Betty says, oh they decided they will keep your account open.... after ALL THAT.  I asked her who in their right mind would continue to do business with PNC Bank?   I got all my money out of my account except that $1,000.  I am still waiting to see what lies I will hear and hoops I have to jump through to get the last of my funds out of the grasp of PNC Bank.  I asked Adrian why they were holding my $1,000.  He said he didn't know but once I got it I would have to go back up to the PNC Branch to close my account to keep from accruing fees.  I hate them so much right now.I suggest anyone even considering using PNC Bank to run, RUN, unless you want them to freeze access to your money, without notice to you, for a week at a time, bounce your rent payments, and keep portions of your funds indefinitely without explanation.  Outrageous!   It appears that PNC Bank's security is so lacking, and they have been fooled so much, that they will put everyday customers like myself through hell to the point that it frustrates the whole point of having a demand account.  If you cannot pay me my money on demand, and you make my payments for my obligations late as a result, what good are you as a bank?  NONE.","August 06, 2022","2022-08-06",NULL,NULL

I then had a PNC rep call me and question the deposits, which I explained. Then I received deposits again this morning and it showed a $2400 balance in my account as I had $900 already in the account and another $1,400 kicked in. I then transferred $1,300 into my savings acct at PNC and a few hours later I get a low threshold alert of $0 in every account leaving me with no money for the weekend. I then called and the bank explained that all my transactions were now pending with a $0 balance in all accounts and quite possibly it would be cleared by Monday. So I told them to cancel my transfer so at least I'd have the $900 back in my account and they refused to. What is the most idiotic thing is the fact that the transfer wasn't from an external bank but from the same bank from checking to savings and they still placed a hold on funds that actually existed and were not from a pending deposit. At the very least they should have credited the $900 which was clear and held off in the remainder.","July 30, 2022","2022-07-30",NULL,NULL

During the migration, customer service had no clue what was going on and could not answer questions. Then, after the launch occurred, trying to get in touch with a live human was almost impossible (the mobile app at least allowed you to “chat”, but the answers from their agents were scripted). Now, if / when I call to try to get help, they simply want to pacify you with what little information that can share and then pawn you off to another dept or push you to the website to get help. I had to file a dispute with them regarding an erroneous payment I made to the wrong doctor and it has been months since I asked for help. I sent them all the info and documentation they asked for, but no word on status, no communication at all. When I call, they say it will a being handled and that I’ll get a letter or something, but refuse to put me through to anyone.  Strangely, in the past few weeks, I’ve received numerous messages from “customer experience” reps saying that are following up on my dispute l, but when I talk to them they ask for a lot of w personal info the bank should know, so now I’m suspicious of phishing.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Again with another complaint","Jennifer Corsivo","Again with another complaint. When I opened an account I went through BBVA and I absolutely loved them. At the time to avoid any kind of fees all I had to do was add a savings account, which I did. Now that it's PNC all that is out the window. You have to either ha for a direct deposit of 500 every month or keep a balance of five hundred dollars in your account. My money gets spent as fast as it comes in, I will never keep that much in my checking and I don't work a job that does direct deposit anymore. I shouldn't have to take out of savings to cover these fees because that would defeat the purpose of having a savings account. I wouldn't complain if I had fees coming out of one account but I have two checkings, one savings and a credit card through with fees that all add up, fees I didn't have before. I beleive that if you were a BBVA customer prior to transitioning to PNC then the contract they signed should follow them. I didn't sign up for PNC, I was forced to merge. I was told I would get a a call from the escalations department regarding the issues in two to three business days. When I never received the call I called PNC back and the customer service rep told me that I already received a call and that the matter was resolved. I told her I absolutely did not receive a call and the problem was not resolved and to say a matter has been resolved just simply because you want to avoid the issue is just plain bad business practice.

A few of my auto payments that were set up with Compass Bank never carried through with PNC Bank.  I hadn't realized this until I got notice of a lapsed monthly payment from merchants that I've always been in good standing with.  If you need to know the routing number with any of your PNC Bank accounts, it is very difficult to find on their website. Transferring money from another bank can also take several days to be deposited into your PNC checking account. 6 business days have passed since I initiated a money transfer and the deposit still hasn't showed up in my PNC account. This is unacceptable.  I could've walked to this bank from my house and made the deposit sooner.

And I’ve not once taken the time to write a negative review for any company or service because I’m pretty lenient, and like to think of everyone as human and capable of mistakes. But this place needs to get their s**t together. Seems like most reviews show they’ve had bad experiences buying bitcoin, well I’ve had a pretty bad one trying to sell mine for cash. After searching online for hours which ATM allows you to SELL bitcoin, I came across these guys. Went to a kiosk, and tried to sell $1000 worth of bitcoin. Everything looked good, it gave me a QR code to send the BTC to, and after I sent it I received a link to my phone to track the status. Went and sat in my car for about 30 mins til the BTC transaction was fully confirmed, then got a text saying the cash was ready for pickup and to go back to the kiosk. Went back, and was told by the kiosk screen they can’t complete the transaction because the kiosk doesn’t have the cash available. OH COOL, so there isn’t a system in place to prevent me from starting a transaction that they can’t fulfill? Weird. Anyways…. The kiosk then gives me a drop down menu of other kiosks in the area that have the available cash, so it “transfers” the transaction to the other kiosk I choose. Found one that was 20 minutes away… so I chose that one. I drive there, excited to finally finish this mess. Guess what? Same error! You’ve got to be sh*tting me. No cash in the machine. It gives me the same prompt “please select another location”. Unfortunately now the nearest location is further away, about 35 minutes backwards from where I live… so I call their support team and explain the issue. I said “listen, I only want to drive to this other location if you can absolutely guarantee me that this kiosk actually has the funds to give me”. They assured me it did and that it’s rare for a machine to not have the available cash. Funny cause it already happened twice. Before I leave, silly me decides to try another transaction for $500, hopeful that maybe the machine was maybe short in cash but had enough to do $500. I sent the btc and get the same error even after it does tell me it has enough cash to complete the $500. Now I’ve got $1500 missing and need to recover. Anyways, I take the drive, finally get there, and I get another similar BS error. Tried twice just to make sure it wasn’t an error with my phone. Nope, sure enough their system is just really whack and yet again it doesn’t have the cash. Now I’m annoyed. 2 hours of driving, all while the price of bitcoin is dropping in value and I can’t complete this damn thing. I get home and after waiting on hold  with their support team, they keep trying to give me alternative locations to pick up the cash. I politely tell them I’ve had enough and I can’t risk making more drives to empty machines. At this point I honestly think I’m getting scammed. The support member mentions she can refund me, asks for my btc address, and I reply to a text with the info. After getting put on hold for another 5 mins she comes back saying she talked to her team and since the transaction is in “this status” I’m not entitled to a refund. Now I’m really about to kiss my money goodbye. How am I not entitled to a refund if the original agreement wasn’t satisfied? Should it be my responsibility to go drive another hour out of state to find a machine that MIGHT (emphasis on the might part) actually have my cash? I think I’ve been more than patient enough at this point by driving to 3 locations, most would already be furious after the first one. I explain I really need this fixed somehow because I have no other options and to please help me. I get put on hold again for 20 mins then am told they processed the refund. I was nervous at first, and was told it might take 24 hours to receive. But at this point, I already considered the money gone so figured if a refund hits, GREAT. If not, I guess it’s my fault for not being smarter. I’m happy to report that this morning I DID receive my refund. When I woke up I almost decided to not leave a negative review, however, the absolutely ridiculous BS hoops I had to jump through to get my money back is not okay, and I hope someone sees this review and gives it thought before going through the same crap I did. 1 star for the fact I did get a refund, but 0 stars on every other aspect. DONT ALLOW YOUR MACHINES TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS IF THEY CANT FULFILL THEM. I can’t be the first or the last person this happens to. This company could have a lot of potential, the machines themselves look great, they’re easy to navigate, they look smooth and modern and inviting, unlike the old ugly ATMs you see at the gas stations. But guess what? I’ve used those old ugly btc ATMs that charge crappy fees, and they dispensed my cash within 5 seconds… I’ll keep going there and not get sucked into another 5 hours of BS like this company did me.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","The absolute worst, yet still managing to go even lower","Dear Customer","The absolute worst…yet still managing to sink to lower depths. PNC seems confused about what a bank is/does..basically math…and whose money they have.  Hint:  it’s not theirs!  I can count on one hand the overdrafts I’ve had in the decades I’ve been their customer (usually because some someone illegally took thousands of dollars from the account which has happened more than once). And, although Ive been their ‘very good customer’..their words.. and overdrafts are backed up by my other PNC accounts, they still charge you.  They make it almost impossible to do anything about your account/money. Basically, take the day off to get through to anyone…who will usually send you somewhere else. They’ll give your money away to anyone. As I said, thousands have illegally been taken from my account which processed IMMEDIATELY, but a $10 check to me will sit in pending for days.  When my new debit card needed activated, I had to call…even though they say you can do it online…on their site that’s down for updates constantly, and it used to be automatic based on your phone number, but now it’s wait and wait and get transferred and hung up on.  Yet, after I activated new card, they were still processing charges on old card..so a lot of autopay accounts took money twice! I’ve put a limit on when to be notified if a charge exceeds a certain amount. Never happens. They’ll cash a ‘check’ written on a napkin from a stranger, but I have to answer 12 questions to speak to anyone, and, of course, I’m wrong, because I suddenly forgot my pin or SSN?! They are not only criminally incompetent, they’ll do anything to try and overdraft your account, find anyway to take your money, and don’t ever get a credit card through them….highest interest I’ve seen.  But although I pay my card in full, on time, plus whatever interest they charge so I’m actually paying off debt, they get upset if you use your card!  ‘Update your income!’emails come as soon as you charge anything. It’s the same income they’ve been playing fast and loose with for years. It’s no surprise they’re failing, closing branches, etc. Hopefully they’ll be bought by a competent banking institution…like the mob.","June 02, 2022","2022-06-02",NULL,NULL

PNC confirmed that they could not tell where it was done from since it was not a PNC ATM, this could have been done in China for all I know.Point is it was allowed zeroesecurity and then they kept asking me if I wanted to dispute it, really?? I tell you unauthorized activity and you have to ask 5+ times if I really was to dispute it?Allowing a deposit with no security is like letting a thief come look in your front window and check the door lock without a concern.

Some nights they won't accept deposits, and other times you can't even withdraw your money.  Also, many of the branches ATM'S are in dark areas that are not well lit up and could be an accident waiting to happen.  I see a huge difference between them and Chase. I also just had my account hacked and PNC tried to blame me for one of the charges to Spectrum. They said because I use Spectrum that I must of did that charge. Really? I wasn't in Sacramento the day that person hacked my account.  PNC...do your jobs and dig a little deeper. You don't need to pin things on your customers. I am planning on closing my account soon enough.  I don't recommend PNC  bank.  They are horrible and have shotty customer service.

Customer service checked my account and after a few minutes I was told everything was in order that if I want the car title I need to request it at my county or local DMV.Recently I was notified that there was a event to my credit report which affected my credit score; when I checked my credit report I noticed the loan in question (PNC Bank/BBVA) is sending them a report as I owe them money. Like I owe them for March payment and this event is affecting my credit score negatively. I was never late to payments and I did my due diligence to call and ask for a pay-off amount. Wanting to clarify this situation I called again 04/15/22. On this day, I got transferred on multiple occasions and after a little over 2 hours I was told that it shows I owe money but that someone will call me to clarify the situation with me.

Called the bank and was told that unless I have some type of activity, the account would be deactivated and the funds would be turned over to the state. I have to physically call in at least every 3 years for the account to stay active. The fact that I log in on a regular basis apparently doesn't count. I asked them to close the account and transfer the funds to another bank. I opened 2 other savings account at the same time for the same amount with 2 different banks and they never deactivated my accounts.  I asked them to close the account and since they have a $5k limit on daily transfer out of the account, I told them I would accept a paper check ONLY because the rep told me the check would be overnighted. I never received my check. Over the next two weeks I called them numerous times, spoke to multiple supervisors, bounced around to different departments and no one could tell me when the check would be issued nor when I would receive it. I was told repeatedly that an escalation member would call me but no one has. I am outraged that PNC has over $100k of my money and refuses or incapable of telling me where my money is.

Recently I found out that the only way to change your debit card PIN was to visit a branch or PNC ATM. Since I don't live in Pennsylvania, that's a little hard to do (no branches near me at all). With that said, I'm in the process of withdrawing all my funds and moving to another bank with better rates (and the ability to change a PIN online).

The PNC customer service person gave me the wrong advice. She should have told me that the check had been issued and I should wait a little longer. As it turned out the hospital charged me a fee for the cancelled check. They eventually refunded the fee but not without a lot of difficulty. Now I paid this hospital bill on the hospital website. Immediately after I received 2 emails from PNC indicating that the bill was paid twice. So I logged into my account and PNC does have the transaction listed as being paid twice. I called the hospital first this time and I was told that the payment was only in their system once, NOT twice. I was advised to call the bank. I called PNC and there ARE 2 payments made but since they did not hit the system yet I should call back tomorrow to get the one transaction disputed and a refund issued. I am truly afraid that the bill will not be paid and I will have to go through another mess to clear this up.

They barely speak English. Need to send a bill pay check? It may get there in 3 weeks...if you're lucky. Good thing is I know my money's somewhere. Bad thing is I can't do much with it or plan.

The bank's own records show it was received on time by wire transfer and that my mortgage was fully paid on that date; no late fee was assessed. Because of the holiday PNC didn't post the payment to my account for several days and it was reported as late to the credit agencies. I asked PNC to correct their records and retract the negative comment, they said I had to do a formal dispute. I did (with both PNC Bank and TransUnion) but PNC declined to retract the comment and TransUnion deferred to its decision. I had one late payment during the life of the loan -- three years ago when I had to choose between my mortgage payment or a funeral for my identical twin. The bank was uninterested in the circumstances and reported the late payment. That report was accurate; this one was not. My credit score dropped significantly and is affecting quoted interest rates for refinancing from other banks.

A couple of issues with PNC loan processing. 1) Unresponsive loan officer. My officer mentioned the expectation of phone/email replies are in 3 days. Even so, one of my email inquiry took more than a week. 2) Ignorant loan officers. I have been in contact with two loan officers about the document feedbacks from the underwriting team. They were both unable to explain what the underwriting team is expect. Once one officer told me confidently that my revised doc is all good, but it turned to be rejected by underwriting team again. 3) Unmotivated loan officer. PNC takes zero initiative to address customer's issues. It is said that other lenders would simply solicit appropriate documents from HOA, banks, insurance agencies, etc. This bank considers these are your job. On top of that, they don't know what documents their underwriting team are looking for. Other than copy-and-paste, their loan officers know nothing.4) Mismanaged customer service phone line. I called during the line's normal business hour, about one hour until close. The line did forward my call to an operator, it turned out nobody answered the phone for 5 minutes until I hang up.

Then, she improved my credit further by offering me a fixed rate credit card with a great limit with an APR better than any other offers I’ve had (and there are constant offers). She made everything easy, she knew every detail, and she stayed longer hours so I could get there after work.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Worst bank EVER! STAY AWAY FROM PNC!","Kym Hayman","Worst bank EVER!PNC put a hold on my debit card for ""investigative potentially fraudulent use"". I would not have even known this if I hadnt tried to use my card. When I called customer service, I was transferred 6 different times and was on the phone over 2 hours! I was THEN informed of the hold. I spoke to Kim (the last representative I spoke to) and she lifted the hold and stated I shouldn't have anymore issues but I would have to call the next morning to have a new debit card issued. I did that, as well as paid the $25 expedited fee. I received my card on Wednesday. I had to call PNC because instead of using my same pin number, they apparently changed it. However, the representative activated the card and told me to use it as credit until the pin number arrived in the mail. Thursday evening, I got a notice my account was in low cash mode. Keep in mind, there were 3 digits in that account  ($xxx.xx). I immediately called PNC, once again. This time they informed me that the account was being closed. When I asked why, they could not give me a reason, only told me to call another number in the morning. I called that number this morning and they advised that there was nothing they could do, the account was closed and they would mail me a check of what was in my account! I told them they needed to also refund my $25 expedited fee I paid last Friday as well. I was told they will ""put in a request"" but no guarantees. I NEVER had issues with my account when it was BBVA! PNC Bank have poor customer service and no one knows what's going on.

"PNC Bank","2 out of 5","PNC's Online and Mobile Banking is Outdated","Jonathan Savage","I am a former BBVA customer. The BBVA website and smartphone app were second to none. They worked great and PNC should have used it. PNC's mobile and online banking look and operate like you would expect from 2002, not 2022. For example, when viewing your transactions on their website, you have the option to view only the most recent or ALL OF THEM. Every time I try to view something from outside the most recent, it takes forever to load and locks up my browser. Another example is the way they display your account balances. In addition to the normal Posted Balance and Available Balance, they have a display call Free Balance. The idea is it shows you cash flow based off what you have in the bank compared to any schedule transactions. It doesn't take into account deposits. IT IS USELESS. You can't turn it off and its the first thing you see on the smartphone app.  Today I had a small panic when logged in and the website showed a balance of $1000 in my account. When I opened the mobile app it only showed a balance of $23.58. The app shows the Free Balance by default and the site shows the Posted/Available. Want to view your account and routing number? Well, AFTER you have logged in and are looking at your account, you then have to navigate through other pages and then submit a request where they send you a code to get to view your information. Is it for security concerns that someone might steal your info?  This makes no sense as you are already logged in and are able to transfer funds and make payments without the additional steps. The data migration from BBVA to PNC did not go smoothly. My accounts, my parents', and several of my friends have all had issues. We're talking getting locked out of personal and large business accounts and having other family members' names on the wrong accounts. I tried to order some checks from a branch only to find out 3 weeks later the order was never submitted. As a former BBVA/Compass customer, I am not happy and will be looking for a new home for our money as soon as I get the time to move and update all of my accounts again.","February 01, 2022","2022-02-01",NULL,NULL

So I start calling then, but nobody answers the phone.  Only way to communicate is by going to the branch in-person, or by e-mail. Many back-and-forths, but after 12 days, still no approval and we are closing on the sale.  Gave up on PNC and put the money into a completely different bank instead.  Note:  we were not asking for a loan, just wanted to deposit a big chunk of money.  Discussed at closing, guess what?  The buyers, the buyers' realtor, and our realtor all were having trouble with PNC!  We had been doing business with BBVA/Compass for 20 years, with few problems, which they always worked out.  But PNC takes over and we try to open a new account, they suddenly don't want our money?  Note:  their personnel were courteous to us, but whoever makes the big decisions - like what phone system to use, how many people to hire in Legal, etc.- that doofus needs to be run off pronto.","January 03, 2022","2022-01-03",NULL,NULL

Said it has to come from insurance company. Ummm no. The letter of guarantee comes from the lean holder. It has taken this long to get that letter over to my insurance company after many requests and myself going into a branch where no one knew their left from their right. And then they had the nerve to hit me with a late fee in my payment. Customer service is horrible. Wait and hold times are ridiculous. Will never use this so called financial institution ever again. And my car is still not paid off from my insurance company because the letter of guarantee was not emailed over until 12/28. But my insurance company has been requesting this letter since 10/28/2021.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Get used to waiting on hold","Curt Glatz","Summary: just pick another bank. The former BBVA tellers are great and I have no qualms with them, but the call center is abysmal. You'll get very familiar with the hold music and running around in circles.First issue happened after they acquired BBVA. They sent me a new card and boasted about my password and username staying the same, but they didn't mention my PIN changed. So I got locked out when I tried making a purchase. Because it was the evening, I had to wait until the next business day to get help, and they unlocked my account then.Few weeks later, I needed to make an urgent Zelle payment. When I tried doing the payment, they locked my account again and wouldn't process the transaction. They gave zero reason why. So I went to the bank and asked for help. I had wonderful service from the teller, but all she could do was tell me to call the help line with her there, so I did. After waiting for 30 minutes they answered, only to put me on hold again for another 30 minutes. When they finally answered, they told me ""a branch member has to call."" They wouldn't let me hand the phone to the branch member right there, so she had to call the same help line and wait an outlandishly long time. Major red flag is that the tellers have the same help line as the customers.When they finally answered her, after waiting a similar amount of time, they told her that I needed to call them and not her. I left because I needed to be at work, but I called again later. Luckily, I only needed to wait 10 minutes before anyone answered. Unfortunately, they took my information, said they'd put me on hold, and hung on me. So I called again and waited another 10 minutes. Rather than helping me, like you think customer service would do, they told me a branch member needed to call and then lied to me about how the branch member that I saw call them never called. Immediately after the call, I made a new account at another bank.","December 28, 2021","2021-12-28",NULL,NULL

The check was tracked on its journey. The check was sent to the old address then forwarded to the new address then PNC held the check for almost two weeks before it finally was cashed. This made the payment appear to be late. They gave us no grace period during this transition,  charged us a late fee.  Then my husband and I both began receiving harassing phone calls & text messages sometimes 5 times a day at work and home.

I was trying to make extra ""principal only"" payments to be able to pay off my car sooner.

I mailed the second check the next month and did the same.I logged onto my account and of course neither payment was processed as Principal Only.I called, because they don't have a chat option of course, to get help fixing it.  The gentleman assured me he would back out the payments and have them applied correctly.  He did this, and then I get a letter in the mail suggesting I stopped making payments on my loan and that I still owed them money.  I ignored those letters, assuming it was automatically generated, idiotic or not, by their system.  I was right.I then mailed a 3rd extra payment in the same manner as before.  Again, not applied correctly.I was so irritated by their incompetence, I scraped together the money and just paid off my car right then and there online. I don't understand how their people are so incompetent and their processes are so antiquated, but I am certain of one thing.  I will never do business with PNC again, and I will tell anyone who will listen about my terrible experience with them.Prior to all of this, I had a name change and was trying to get information about how to change my name on their records.  I was quickly told I would have to go to a local branch to get that completed.  The Rep obviously didn't bother to look at the State where I live.  If she had, she would have noticed that there isn't a PNC Bank in the entire State.  So lazy!  Instead of giving me all the options, she just tells me to go to the local branch.

FYI...don't use the debit card lock feature if you might possibly want to unlock the card at night during one of their weekly system updates. Not only does the lock/unlock option disappear for 2-3 hours during these system updates (PNC confirmed this has been a long-known issue by them), leaving you unable to use your debit card if it was locked prior to the update beginning, they also conveniently don't offer any sort of customer support during the overnight hours either. Additionally, I can't even begin to tell you how many issues I have run into trying to utilize their online banking system. In fact, as I write this review, their online banking system is completely down. I cannot for the life of me, fathom why anyone would choose to do business with these clowns. How is this bank still in business? On top of all of this, they also have the audacity to take my once free small business checking account I had with BBVA, and now force me to start paying a monthly fee for it. They have another thing coming if they think I will ever pay a single damn dime for a vastly inferior product than what BBVA offered for free.","November 18, 2021","2021-11-18",NULL,NULL
"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","I needed a copy of a check written on…","Jane","I needed a copy of a check written on my BBVA account 10 months ago. I tried to get it online at my new PNC account. The site said the check was too old and I had to go to the bank. I did. The teller didn't know how to get it so she called HQ. They didn't know either. It took 5 days to get a fax copy. Then, five days after that, they sent a package of all checks cleared that month to only my husband.My husband is beginning to have some real cognitive issues so I got BBVA to alert me any time he withdrew more than $500 from the bank. PNC can't do that. They can alert me to all kinds of nonsense but not that.You cannot walk into the bank and even hope to see a banker. You must make an appointment. That is pretty much hidden on the web site. When I tried on the phone app, I got a message saying I had to go to the bank to make the appointment. In the bank they have a sign at the entrance extolling their virtues and it has a QR code in the lower left hand corner, just inches above the floor, which you can scan to make an appointment. I tried three times and each time I got a request to install a Dasher app.They aren't even open part of Saturday so that we can remove our names from our son's account.","November 17, 2021","2021-11-17",NULL,NULL

I've had no access to my money for 2 months but luckily I also bank with another(much better) bank so I'm able to survive. I can't imagine what I would do if I needed my money that's locked up with PNC to pay for my mortgage, car payments, and most importantly food for my family. PNC are an absolute disgrace! Their team members even agree with me that the account was wrongfully frozen but won't take the measures to fix it within an acceptable time frame. I've been specifically dealing with a guy a who is supposedly ""high up"" in the rankings but is completely full of it. He's assured me he would take care of this as soon as possible and that unfreezing an account typically takes 3-5 days max.

I called PNC on October 22nd and after talking to 2 different people because the first one could not be of assistance for whatever reason, PNC CLAIMED they sent me out a box of checks on September 23rd. They then informed me I should receive them in 7 to 10 business days. WTH ?? It had been a month and yet I would receive them in 7 to 10 business days??? Then they informed me that I could re-order them and pay a fee. Why should I have to pay a fee? I didn't chose to be their customer. I did not have time to wait for checks to come in, nor did I really want to order an entire box from them on my dime since I was planning on switching banks asap due to the horrible customer service I just experienced and the hour of my life I just wasted being on the phone with them. I went to my nearest branch which was formerly a BBVA branch that still maintained the BBVA staff (who actually know what customer service is) to get a temp check so I could pay my rent. I explained what  PNC customer service said about my checks being mailed out on September 23rd to the teller and he looked into it. PNC NEVER mailed out any checks. As soon as I finished there, I went home and opened an account online with Frost. Their customer service is AMAZING! I get a live person every time I call without ever having to wait for more than 5 minutes or having to select 101 options on an automated system. The best part about Frost is they actually know what they are talking about and are more than happy to help you.

Fully 3 weeks after the transition, I can never get through to a representative at the headquarters. I either am disconnected, or the rep acts as if they cannot hear me and then disconnects. I have both personal and two business accounts with PNC, but the transition has only allowed me to set up online banking for the personal account. The story for the business accounts is that it may take another 2 weeks to allow online access. I told my local PNC branch that I am closing my business accounts and going elsewhere.","November 01, 2021","2021-11-01",NULL,NULL

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Prior BBVA customer - With PNC can no longer pay rent simply with transfer to individual's account","Gregory Johnson","I just dealt with the transition from BBVA to PNC. I used to pay my rent with autopay set up only using my landlord's account and routing number for their BOA account.  Now with PNC I can use bill pay for an individual, but my landlord would be sent a paper check.  Really?  Besides that PNC only uses third-party apps for transfers and with Zelle I'm limited to only $1,000 each day, meaning I'd have to pay part one day and the rest the next.  I don't want to start doing that to my landlord and I don't want to have to manually make two payments each month since you can't even set it to auto.  In this crazy world as the powers that be take control over every bit of our lives, including our personal banking, maybe all banks are going that way.  But I will no doubt be looking for a new bank now.  Really???... I can't simply transfer to Bank of America using the landlord's account and routing number?  So stupid.

Then, just switch banks.","Dr. Aimee Wright","I become an involuntary customer of PNC Bank when they bought out BBVA/ Compass Bank effective only 11 days ago.  Already they've lost my trust.i sincerely hope that you do not EVER need to contact PNC's customer service department!  Not only did they provide me with one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but they apparently do not have a mechanism in place to file a complaint!  Two different reps told that they were going to file a complaint “on (my) behalf”, and that someone should call me within 2-3 business days.  That was 8 days ago. Still no call. When I directly asked the 2nd rep how I could file my OWN complaint on my OWN behalf, she literally told me to go complain on Twitter!  TWITTER?!?!  Really??All I wanted to know was if a specific check had cleared that I wrote back about 6 months ago. They only have the last 90 days of statements from BBVA/Compass loaded to the PNC website, and the BBVA website is shut down.I am not kidding or exaggerating when I tell you that it took over 6 1/2 hours to get an answer.I used the chat feature on their website to message my question at 2:15 pm. They finally responded at 5:33 pm, then kept me on the chat line until 8:16 pm asking the same questions over and over, telling me they were getting a manager, then that the manager wasn’t coming, that they didn’t have access to that, then that they would fax it or mail it, but couldn’t give me online access, then that they couldn’t even do that, and I would have to go into a branch etc, etc,etc….Finally she suggested that I call their toll free number. After almost 3 hours of chatting she basically told me that I was SOL, but that she was “filing a complaint on my behalf”! I did call their toll free number and the woman who answered was very helpful and apologetic, accessed my statements from April-September and answered my question.  She also said she was filing a complaint on my behalf, which I appreciate, but she’s the one who then told me to go on Twitter to file my own complaint! We got off the phone at 8:47 pm.That’s 2:15 - 8:47 pm total time, and 5:33 - 8:46 pm that required my active participation such that I was not able to do anything else.UNACCEPTABLE!!Both reps very polite, but their sheer incompetence has me planning moving my business account to another bank after almost 20 years!

If you are using a third party software to manage  your accounting dont use PNC Bank services.  They do not offer simple banking plans for a small business.  I opened up an account just to have money in and money out and I have to use there accounting profiles and extra services to pay my suppliers and contractors.  Its a waste of time and money for me.  On the simpler of the versions they send physical checks to vendors and that takes weeks to get to the person you owe money to.  If you upgrade for a fee its still a four to five day wait.  If you take it up one more level you are nicked and timed to just to transfer money in 24 hours.  So if you are using a third party software like QB’s to manage your money this is not worth it.  You will be doing everything twice and paying for it twice.  If you dont use a third party software this might be ideal for  you but be prepared to die from a thousand cuts.

However, I later found out that I could not create an online account unless I had a checking account with PNC. Four months after I bought the car, I moved but PNC insisted I needed to go to a physical branch to change the address for authenticity. They refused to ask me 20 questions to verify who I was. Therefore for 3.5 years I received no correspondence from the bank for anything else other than marketing products. Unknowingly I underpaid  about $.56 a month so after a few months they charged a late fee, which repeatedly grew per month. Thankfully they reversed it when I called to pay off the loan early.  My biggest disappointment was that they would not provide a letter releasing me from the lien unless I paid $26 to an outside entity. Even after doing so, they refused to send me the title. A duplicate cost me $85 at the Florida DMV county clerk’s office. I will not ever deal with them again. This story did not have a happy ending. A few minor changes to their customer service department and protocols is long overdue. Not providing title after paying off the loan??? Please.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Shady bank","Bonnie","With any other bank, the pending transactions stay until they're cleared so you can keep track of all of them and the balance at the top will reflect how much you have in your bank account. Not with PNC. You will have to mark down each and every transaction you make so you can keep correct track of them (what's the point if the bank you're banking with can't even show the correct balance?) Because some pending transactions will disappear and show up a few days later. I've run into some cases where I was dangerously close to overdrafting because the balance ""placed back"" the money for the pending transaction that had disappeared. It seems like other people have the same issue with PNC and their overdrafts/fees. If you ""opt out"" of overdraft protection, it will absolutely not matter. PNC will let the transaction go through and charge you for every single overdraft you've made. Literally have never had this issue with any other bank until I had to bank with PNC because that's pretty much one of the only banks in my area. I will be switching soon once the closing fee period has passed. I will take any other bank over this one. Other banks will not let the transaction go through if you've opted out of overdraft protection & keep correct available balances (including pending transactions that don't suddenly disappear and reappear days later) This bank is super shady and unethical. I can see they make their money by being misleading. Make sure you keep an eye on ALL of your transactions (especially if you pay for or buy a lot stuff) so you don't get hit with ridiculous overdraft fees.","August 01, 2021","2021-08-01",NULL,NULL

I asked the Bracnh Manager to call the surviving spouse on the phone & validate this request. The Branch manager was content with company policy and would not investigate the possibility of updating the account name by phone & instead required the surviving account owner to report in person to change the name.  I wanted to contact the Board of Directors to highlight  this deplorable policy & force change, but the branch manager would not provide contact information. Additionally, the branch manager (Britney McMillian) felt it was acceptable to force an elderly immobile customer to report to the Branch location in person rather than validate this request via the phone number the branch location had on file.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","Maybe it’s because I’m an old geezer…","Joe Bunda","Maybe it’s because I’m an old geezer and I can trace the lineage of my PNC bank account all the way back to the late 1970’s to its incarnation as WPNB and through its succession as Equibank, then Integra Bank, then National City Bank, and ultimately PNC Bank…. What started out as a checking account in a customer-friendly local bank eventually became an unimportant account to a huge corporate-friendly mega-bank with oppressive fees and marginal customer service to their private citizen account holders.  Need your missing debit card  replaced?  No problem, as long as you don’t mind a $7 fee and a 7 day wait. Lots of other banks, large and small, will send a replacement card overnight or 2nd day delivery free of charge.  Want a free checking account?  PNC has one, as long as you’re ok with not touching the $500 minimum balance. Other banks just want a monthly deposit with no minimum balance.  Want free checks?  Hey, no worries!  But only if you choose one of their top of the line accounts with a $25 monthly fee. Other banks, well…. you might see the pattern here. I could go on, but like I started out saying, I’m an old geezer. If it weren’t such a tedious process, I’d switch to another bank or a credit union. Maybe I will.

Please please please check other banks to compare before picking PNC, especially if you're traveling all the time. I am in the military, and it was horrendous. Ohio is my home of record, and I decided to stay loyal to PNC longer than I should.  I ALWAYS had trouble contacting them when I was stationed in Germany, Italy, Korea, even Missouri. I did not lose my PIN. It was automatically wrong. We have done this 3 times by mailing it to my Father's (home of record), therefore, had no way to get cash for a week and a half, and it was considered 'my fault.' I would have to drive from Fort Leonard Wood ' 3-hour drive' closest to PNC and get a new PIN. I would have to update my living status, so they don't close my cards every month or 3 months. I don't remember exactly, compared to other banks, it every 6 months to a year. FYI, I love USAA. So if you're planning to live on the east coast forever, and ever and ever, then go for PNC. And what's even worse, I am currently trying to close them, but they never did. I am still having issues with them after calling them that I want my checking and saving closed A MONTH AGO. I can't escape from them. I'm trying so hard, but they're making it so difficult for me. I am getting stressed FROM A BANK I'M TRYING TO GET OUT OF!!!! I even wanted to check my accounts online, but of course, they down on maintenance. (still have my credit cards. I don't use it, just keeping my credit score).

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","I spoke with Casey a PNC Customer…","Ryan James DeLaney","I spoke with Casey a PNC Customer Service Manager via phone 2-26-21 for 57 minutes to be exact. Casey was rude and not helpful at all. In fact Casey solution was... “he will use my case as a training service for the fraud department” The PNC Fraud Department was/is supposed to help me with fraud that I experienced  back in December 2020. Here is my story:On 12-30-20 I checked my online account and noticed there was unusual activity. Two separate charges for a tattoo parlor in Chicago.$100$500I had my card in my possession and I don’t have any tattoos. Naturally I call PNC bank customer service # on the back of my Visa card. I got connected to the Fraud Department. The rep reviewed my account and also confirmed the unusual charges. They canceled my card and said they are going to start the Fraud procedure and the first step is canceling my card and issuing me a new one. The Fraud Department said they will refund me the 2 separate payments in the amount of $600. That refund was deposited in my account on 12-31-20 the very next day and that was it, I heard nothing more and assumed everything was taken care of.2-26-21 (2 months) later I wake up to a provisional credit reversal of 2 separate charges.$100$600I naturally call the back of my visa card like I did in December thinking I am experiencing more Fraud not knowing what “provisional credit reversal means”.I speak to Daniel who was absolutely no help so I asked if I could speak to a manager. Daniel stated he can have a manager call me back in 24 - 48 hours. I said that actually isn’t going to work for me and my situation, I would like to speak to a manager now. I was put on hold for roughly 20 minutes (I understand not upset about that, usually normal) then Daniel comes back on the line and introduces me to Casey the customer service manager of PNC.I expressed to Casey why I am confused. I stated. . .“I don’t understand why I have $600 of “provisional credit reversal” charges and what does that mean and why?Casey explained that back in December on 12-30 I reported Fraud in the amount of $600. Casey said on the 12-31 PNC deposited a credit of $600 into my account (Fraud Protection). Then Casey said the confusion is because the same day 12-30 when I called about the Fraud the Tatoo Parlor re-deposited $600 into my account. That is where I get confused and something sounds fishy at this point. So now it looks/ seems I got my Fraud money back from the Tatoo Parlor for $600 dollars on 12-30 and I got $600 deposited into my account on 12-31 by PNC and that equals $1,200.My question for Casey at this point in the conversation...1. Why would the tattoo parlor deposit A Fraud transaction back into my account?2. If my account was being investigated/ The Fraud department opened my case on 12-30 why did they not catch the Tatoo parlor deposit $600 into my account on 12-30?3. If it did in fact show I was credited back $600 why did PNC deposit another $600 into my account the very next day 12-31?4. Also why 2 months later is PNC taking $600 out of my account? That is not in my budget for February or any months to be exact.5. I said I was/ am under the impression my account was being reviewed because of Fraud back in December but why 2 months later is PNC catching this so called Tattoo parlor deposit?Casey told me I am going around in circles and there is nothing he can do except he will contact the rep who helped me in December and use this as a training service. Casey basically in my opinion stated our Fraud Department should of caught that back in December but unfortunately did not. I will be switching banks and advising anyone one and everyone to be your own advocate. Bank at PNC at your own risk in my opinion and watch out for Casey, he is just another banker guy who wants to collect a paycheck, which I am personally not interested in banking at a bank that I don’t feel safely and timely assists with my money.","February 26, 2021","2021-02-26",NULL,NULL

I only had a $81  check to my name been receiving unemployment since covid began, which left me with $16.00 and Pnc still will not refund my account, that was my water bill money, and each time I call they give me another excuse that it is going to be a 2 week 10-15 day process.

I submitted the probate documents and, after 3 weeks, started asking the branch personnel what was happening. I was told they had to resubmit the paperwork. After that, the branch told me they hadn’t followed the proper procedure (apparently they didn’t know the proper procedure) and I would have to snail mail it to the legal department directly. Every person son in every department said “I’m sorry. This must be so frustrating, but there’s nothing I can do in this department.” So what department can help? Nobody knew. To make a long story short, I still haven’t resolved this issue. I’m sure that if all you do is let them make money by holding your money, and occasionally you write a check, you’ll be happy with PNC. But anything that involves competence and communication will leave you frustrated and angry. Want to be happy? Bank local.

I started using PNC points for home expenses and PNC cash reward for work purchases, all my tools and materials, were paid weekly using cash rewards card and they were giving me peanuts  as a cash reward because it is a cash reward account. Week after week for months and my credit was improving, one day around September 2018 I didn’t use the card for the entire week because I was off that week, but my credit card continued accruing expenses like if I continued working that week( around $1800 dlls) (I use PNC online banking app) where I monitor in real time my expenses so you always know your daily and weekly expenses pending and posted transactions which reflected in the balance. Balance plus pending transactions  you always have control of your debt and know exactly how much you owe. Somehow they managed to use my previous transactions to which I believe they included in my weekly expenses to steal my money but I was in doubt so I said to myself maybe I was wrong and I owed more and accepted the fact. I continued my life like if nothing happened and about a few months around March 2019 my balance on my cash rewards was around $3500,00 and and my PNC points was about $2000,00 so that Sunday morning using my computer I logged in and made 2 payments $1500,00 to my PNC to my cash rewards card and $500,00 to my PNC points visa card so Monday morning Y was expecting my balance to be Cash rewards $2000,00 and my PNC points $1500, guess what, my PNC points visa card was reflecting  $1500,00 but my cash rewards was reflecting $2380 where did my $380 dollars go. So again a payment was showing that I paid $1500(in green numbers) but my balance was missing $380 so $1800 on September 2017 plus $380 on March 2019 please note that I had no pending transaction over $100,00 coming in that week. when I confronted them by phone and I was speaking with someone a clown voice in the background stated  (How did you know) At which I responded because I’m not stupid, I used PNC app online banking to track my expenses but they never credited the disputed amount stealing my money and did challenge me to prove it in a mocking way. I visited different local branches including the one where I originally opened my accounts and they refused to believe that this was happening, then I visited my closest branch from home  6535 Lake Worth Rd, Lake Worth, FL 33467 and the branch manager a woman Which surname is (Fifi) invited me to close my accounts instead of refunding my money. Again, I want people to know that this guys are vulgar rats, stealing my kids future. Nevertheless saying my interest rates increased to criminal 35% and every month I was paying almost $300 in interest charges for cash rewards and $90 for  PNC points and that’s not the worst, I paid them interest for over a year from money stolen from me. At this point in time I’m sure I was targeted by the bank administration to steal from me instead of profit from me, because when my credit was around 780 I asked for a loan to buy a mobile home for my family  an they declined twice one for a home and one for a dump truck. I just moved my money out of this racist people. I hope this helps other people to watch over their accounts closely and thanks for reading all the way here and please like and share so other people know. I believe they’re targeting Hispanics (Mexicans?) may they wanted to charge me for the Border Wall. Well they don’t want my business I just moved to another bank.

I have had nothing but problems since banking with PNC and it has only been a couple of months. Their employees are rude, nonchalant, and racist. I recently needed to visit a local branch to get some cash since I had not received my replacement card at the time. The branch lobby was closed and by appointment only, but I was unaware of that. I did not want to go through the drive thru since I was not driving. And you cannot use the cardless feature on the app at the ATM if you do not have a PNC bank card activated on your account. One of their elitist and nasty employees saw that I needed help and refused to assist me or even ask if I needed anything. I left because I did not want to end up getting shot for being Black or arrested for assault if I would have lost my temper! I contacted corporate and of course they apologized but it means nothing. These companies could not care less about Black people. How can any company say that Black Lives Matter when your entire executive board is filled with White people??? There are countless persons of color, including myself, that have college degrees and never even get considered for executive positions, so let's just keep it all the way real. The PNC phone and chat employees are also rude and incompetent. How can you not know about the products and services of the company you choose to work for??? This is why customer service is dead and a thing of the past. These companies make billions of dollars and they pay lower level employees chump change and they come to work miserable with the pay and their personal lives. What kind of s*!t is this??? Makes no sense whatsoever. I will be more than happy when I am done with PNC. I realize that all companies have problems of some sort, but it seems like many of these corporations are run by people who lack working brain cells and simple human decency. This can't be planet Earth sometimes I swear! Do yourself a favor and bank elsewhere. Preserve your mental and physical health and move on.","July 07, 2020","2020-07-07",NULL,NULL

I called over the phone to enquire about a certain amount but soon changed my mind and went for a lesser amount. When I went to the branch to order and pay they bought the higher amount after I instructed them that I wanted the lesser amount, I even wrote it on the order form. They deducted both purchases from my account. How does a bank do this? It took me several phone calls and as of right now, it is still not straight.

"PNC Bank","3 out of 5","Had a random fee on my account","DM","Had a random fee on my account.  Called the virtual wallet customer service line.  Conversation started off fine, after a couple minutes trying to understand the situation the rep kept cutting me off in the middle of my questions and answering with statements that were not even what I was asking.  Attempted to ask again and was interrupted again.  I had to ask her to not interrupt me and I was trying to understand the situation to prevent it happening again in the future.  (I honestly don't remember if I interupted her, but I know I was getting internally frustrated.) She sounded like she was getting really defensive because she could not answer my questions (I honestly don't believe she had the ability too, which isn't on her, that's on PNC) I really think if PNC can pull our recorded call, I think there would be a good learning opportunity for that rep/others.  They ended up refunding the fee as a one time situation.  I'm thankful for that and she seemed frustrated with me that I was trying to figure out why it happened, so it doesnt occur in the future.  The call was just frustrating.  I also work with customers over the phone for a living, so I can understand how annoying it can be when customers call in to just complain to get a fee waived.  I wanted to make the call more constructive and getting the fee waived was a bonus.","February 28, 2020","2020-02-28",NULL,NULL

I must say this was the smoothest Bitcoin purchase by far with no hassles and no holdups. You choose deposit cash to account, they send you an email with a scannable barcode. Take that to the cashier and load anywhere from. $20-$500 as well as a $4.95 processing fee. The money was instantly on my account but took 15 min to clear. Then I purchased my Bitcoin and it sent to my wallet immediately and my wallet verified the deposit and is waiting for the blockchain to finalize it. Super simple and duper easy. The only bad thing I must say is $12 fee for a $120 purchase was a little steep but overall very easy and i will use this method from now on.

I received a phone call from the company on Tuesday, April 18. They explained to me about some issues they had been having with changes that they were having to make due to the recent economic upheavals and that they were trying to get everything taken care of and get my bitcoin sent out. I was encouraged to believe that I should have my bitcoin by the end of this past week. The call was helpful and amiable on both sides. At the end of the call I requested an email to be sent detailing all that had been discussed so that I would have it in writing. I was assured that I would receive an email that day and they requested my email address. As soon as the call was ended, I immediately sent my email address along with a nice note reminding them to please send me the statement of what had been discussed. A couple of hours later I received a text, assuring me once again that I would get an email that day. On Friday, after not having yet received the email, nor the bitcoin, I went back to the mall where I Initially deposited my money in the crypto dispensers ATM  and I spoke with the specialty leasing manager. She placed a call to crypto dispensers and was not able to reach anyone, but was forced to leave a message, which is what happens every time you call. She stated that they needed to get back with her for the issue to be solved that day. She also sent an email  stating the same thing.

"Evergreen Credit Union","5 out of 5","EGCU Above and Beyond in Customer Service","Lisa Dominicus","Today I had one of the best customer service experiences ever at EGCU. It was found my debit card had been compromised and needed to be replaced. I went to the credit union on Broadway in South Portland and as I stood there waiting for a new card I had a great conversation with both the teller working on my issue and another who was waiting for customers. Both were so professional, courteous, and genuinely kind. Not because that's their job but because they sincerely cared and it was apparent. Later at home I had to make a call back to the CU due to an issue updating a site with recurring billing using the new card. I experienced exactly the same level of attention and caring. There came a point where I was so overwhelmed and moved by this I asked who to reach out to there so I could be sure they received my gratitude. I have been a loyal EGCU customer for over 20 years. If anyone asked me to recommend a place to do their banking EGCU is unmatched. When I dealt with staff today I wasn't being waited on at a business. I felt like I was part of a family.

I have not regretted it at all.The staff are all friendly and helpful. After opening the account I started slowly using them. I wanted a new camper and asked about a loan. They made the process so easy. I secured a loan with them. Just last week I decided to switch my direct deposit and move all my banking needs to them.

I called to inquire about a loan and had a few preconceived ideas of what I was thinking for a rate and a timeline. I had a short conversation about my needs and expectations and was reassured that we were in line with each other. After a 5 minute phone, I was sure that I could get a rate that I wanted for a time duration I expected and had an appointment on a Saturday morning as soon as the doors opened. After 10 minutes I had a check in had to go purchase my vehicle and confident that the loan was everything I expected. The rate was better than the dealerships I had been dealing with and was in my new vehicle by noon.If my other experiences buying a vehicle were ever this great I would want to buy a new vehicle every year.","May 06, 2021","2021-05-06","May 7, 2021","Good Afternoon,Thank you very much for sharing your positive experience with us.We know there are many choices but we are pleased we were able to help.

"Evergreen Credit Union","5 out of 5","15+ Years with Evergreen, and looking forward to many more","The Truth","I have been with Evergreen Credit Union for 15 years? When we applied for a PPP loan a few years ago in 2000, we spoke with Julie Littell, and every word was focused and efficient. I thought, boy would I love to hire her away. I didn't try of course, but that was the level that I saw her at.As far as the PPP forgiveness application, I figured it would be the gargantuan probe of my finances. That's fine, but I hate document gathering. So I procrastinated until after sending 2-3 emails. Kevin Sullivan  finally called me and walked me through the process. Basically he said click a couple buttons. They had already done all the work for me. All the form and what was required was essentially done. All I had to do was review and approve it. Mr. Sullivan was just as efficient as Ms. Littell, and I am starting to realize that it is their culture.I am so glad that I have been with Evergreen Credit Union. Thank you Ms. Littell and Mr. Sullivan, for making the experience as smooth as was physically possible. I am so impressed.","July 01, 2022","2022-07-02","Jul 1, 2022","Thank you for your kind review.

I sat up to Camping World for hours thinking it was them that was the issue but it turns out it was this credit union. Nothing was said until almost three hours later that the loan initiator did not have all the information. Three hours I will never get back. But after that he really stepped up to make sure things flew through. On the billing side of things...also super slow. Just got my info to pay my bill 4 days prior to the due date, Makes me nervous...I always pay my bills well before they are due. But the web site is pretty awesome and easy to set up. Overall not bad just slow on things I think should be addressed as being quicker.Thanks!","June 08, 2022","2022-06-08","Jun 10, 2022","Good Day Kevin,Thank you for your honest feedback.

I ask the girl who waited on me if it would be a problem paying early. She says no, I don't see a problem with it. So I reborrow, after paying. Next month comes and a different girl calls and says I am down to pay that day. I said I don't get my check till the first and the 3rd. She says we'll the 3rd is 4 days out. I said well I get a check the first also and that is 2 days out. She says well your check may be here when you come or it may not be. I said well do what ever you have to but I don't get paid till the first and 3rd. Can come in the first. So today I look at my bank account and sure enough she had turned it in and it's pending. I don't care mind you but the other girl had told me it would be fine. This dark haired girl that called me has always been so hateful. I always avoid having to deal with her and always go to the other register. The black haired girl is a very pretty girl but her attitude and personality and hatefulness does not go with her beauty. But how is one worker saying one thing and another worker saying another helping at all. I been going there for a few years. I will be finding another location.  I will go to the one on Main Street.

The international laws prohibit us from making an account. I am a physician persuing training in the US. I trained there for 4 months and went back home. While there, PNC agreed to open an account for me. They said even if you went abroad, we wouldn’t close the account. I trusted them and placed my entire networth with them, because these were savings made to support my medical residency application in the US and I needed access to an online payment platform . I have access to no other funds anywhere. Just when I needed the money, a message from my prior roommate in the US saying that they had sent mail stating that they were closing the account. Decision is final. I rush to open my PNC app just to find that there’s no way for the money out. I try on transfers, Zelle, I tried everything, they even stopped my debit card. I was not in the US to receive a check. They directed my calls to a number that didn’t have a person on it. They said I had to leave a voicemail and that no callback was guaranteed. Luckily, customer service was willing to re-open my access to the mobile banking app but of course, all activity was limited , I kept trying until I was able to send the money via PayPal account previously linked to the bank. It was very very risky since that people account was not verified by my identity and if they tried to verify my identity and found that I’m Syrian, they wouldn’t have accepted that. They would’ve kept all the money, but thank God that went smoothly. A bank that exploits an extremely unprivileged person who has a goal of improving their career, and had trusted them with all of their savings, is just evil.","July 22, 2023","2023-07-22",NULL,NULL

Disappointed, I begrudgingly waited. After more than 7 business days, I contacted the bank again, where I was then informed that my application was cancelled. Upon asking why, the Rep couldn't give me a clear answer but reassured me that my application would be reinstated. I again waited 3 more days before calling PNC Bank for the 3rd time. The Rep told me my application was still being processed. I asked if there was someone I could talk to in order to clarify the status of my loan. There was no common sense answer from the Rep, almost like I was being bamboozled. After waiting a total of 12 business days, I cancelled my loan application, still with no answer to how/why it took so long to get an answer on a $2000 personal loan for a person with a 800 credit score rating.

"PNC Bank","1 out of 5","This is not a great bank","Karen Finney","I did an ACH transaction on 7/8/2023 for my auto insurance. I knew that the funds weren't available at the time of the transaction, but I knew I had time to have the funds available. I called PNC to verify how long it would take for the transaction to clear, since technically it's a check. I was told 3 business days, which only includes M-F. I made it very clear during the call that it was an ACH payment, and I spoke to more than one rep over the course of 2-3 days to make absolutely certain that what I was told was fact. They all verified what the first agent had told me. Well it turns out that it was not true. I also called on Monday 7/10/2023 to ask if the transaction would still be paid if all funds were not available or if it would be returned and was assured that all that would happen is that I would incur an NSF fee, which I was fine with. It turns out that was also untrue, since I woke up to an email today notifying me that there was a ""decision"" on my account that I needed to address. I logged in and saw that I had until 2pm est. time today to have the funds available, or the payment would be reversed, which would have cancelled my insurance. I do not hold PNC responsible for me not having the funds available, nor do I hold them responsible for upholding their policy. What I DO hold them responsible for is the misinformation that was spread by their representatives. It would be one thing if I was misinformed by ONE rep, but I spoke to several people who ALL misinformed me during my calls with them. I'm not sure if this is the fault of the reps, or the bank itself. The fact that more than one of their employees gave false information indicates to me that this is a widespread issue within that bank's culture and I am seriously reconsidering my relationship with them. I asked that it be escalated to have a higher up contact me about my complaint, but based on some of these other reviews I doubt that very much will change. This may explain why they have had to close so many branches just this year.","July 08, 2023","2023-07-12",NULL,NULL

PNC requires a phone number for PIN verification on login when their system does not recognize the browser. Even though SMS PIN verification is the least secure two-factor authentication mechanism, US banks continue to think they are keeping accounts secure.My real issue is with PNC Customer Disservice. My business account will not accept my mobile phone number because I have it associated with my personal accounts. PNC thinks I should carry multiple phones for their convenience. They have it set up instead to call my business landline, which is currently on my desk 4,200 miles away. I contacted them to find out if I can change it. They won't send email (other banks will) and they said they could have it call my international number, but could not send text messages to it. This was the first call. I was told to message the business unit to have this set up. Half an hour chat session only to be told to call the international customer disservice number again. Two more calls - both times disconnected when the rep didnt' know how to complete a call transfer. Fourth call, I get through and the rep tells me they can set it up, places me on hold for half an hour (cha ching! with international call charges) only to finally get back on the line and say that they cannot do this right now. Customer disservice complaint rep tries to call me on my land line on 7/5 and wonders why I won't answer. Sends me an email. I call today and she tells me that ""while PNC tries not to disconnect customers, it is a phone system after all..."" Yeah, and they can't wait on the line until the receiving department answers to make sure the call isn't dropped. Blaming technology is not an excuse for incompetence and customer disservice.Anyway, the result of today's call (number 5 international call) was nothing except the customer disservice rep would ""document"" my concerns. That's code for ""do absolutely nothing"" and that is exactly what PNC Bank does best.I'll be back in the US in September. My first stop is another bank.

I immediately went into my local branch, spoke with my banker and withdrew all my money. My local branch was horrified by the way I was treated by customer service and filed a complaint with their executive branch. Within 3 days a lovely women called me from PNC for my story. After speaking with her, she told me all my fees for 12 months would be refunded to me immediately. She apologized for customer service and will now find the man that was so rude to me. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE, GO TO YOUR LOCAL BRANCH AND FILE A COMPLAINT TO THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT. They are very helpful and concerned about the poor treatment of their customers.

First transaction took 12 hours, 4 days later I made purchase on Friday and received it Tuesday and now once again made a purchase last night and 8 hours later still nothing. What really angers me is their site stating that most transactions take 15 mins but on RARE occasions, can take up to a hour. What is rare now a days is getting it under 8 hours. And I did my own little test and while waiting, I went to 2 other Bitcoin machines with other companies and had the Bitcoin in minutes. So how can other companies have it out in minutes and you guys take 4 days? And if you are going to be so slow, TELL PEOPLE, so we can go somewhere else. No notice on machine about any possible delays. Company obviously doesn't seem too concerned seeing how many other ppl are staying the same issues.

You receive a paid invoice from Asic Miners Rig.  Another email is sent to you with a 'spoof' carrier website and tracking number.  Then just days before 'spoof' carrier website states asic miner is to be delivered to you.  You receive a generic email from the 'transport carrier' that US Customs is holding up your Asic miner and you need to pay thousands of dollars to have it released. Payment can only be made in crypto or bank wire. If you don't pay then the item will be return and according to asciminersrigs website you will read the following disclaimer... 'Asic Miners Rig Blockchain & Cryptocurrency B.V. shall not be liable for any cost of damage or expense as a result of error from calculating taxes and duties pertaining to your order.Please be noted that upon delivery of the products to the carrier, it shall be deemed completion of our delivery, and the title and the risk of damage and loss of the product(s) shall be transferred to you. This includes possible shipping fees as we do not accept any refund request in case of failure of customs clearance.'Please don't respond asic miners rig (Dan, Max or whatever your names really are) and say ""Where is the proof - where is your invoice - where is your order number.

Few days later they gonna send you a fake tracking number from ""https://transglobalexpress-us(dot)com"" with a express delivery around after 7 days. which is also a scamming company.After few days they gonna ask for $2300 just to do customs clearance and handling. Where they gonna say they will refund you $2000 and gonna keep $300 for fees. Like below:""1 .  Following Section 7, Article 4 (USA-07/4  039746/95) of 13th July 1999 of the USA Tax Administration  and the International Regulatory Board for Cargo transportation ( IRBCT), Customized Packages being transported Within Canada and the United States and across any country in general would have to be registered into the USA Tax scheme.2 . According to Section 8, Article 10 ( USA-07/17  031246/95) of 13th July 1998, the Tax scheme is 100% refundable .

Out of the  2300USD  that you will pay for the Refundable Tax Scheme on your Package, a total of 2000USD would be refunded to you.""If you pay them $2300 amount.

We went to let a teller know that we needed to speak to a loan officer, and then sat in the waiting area for 25 minutes while employees walked through the waiting area--no one making eye contact or saying anything. After the 25 minutes, a manager came out and asked if we had been helped, and if we had told a teller that we were there. After that a loan officer (Jorge) helped us draw up papers. Our 2nd visit was to finalize our transaction. I had emailed Jorge the day before to let him know what time we were able to come in. We peeked in to see if Jorge was busy, and he helped us immediately. I would give this visit 5 stars!

Yes, at the moment, instant transfers are not supported using your NorthOne Mastercard® Debit Card. We are looking into methods of supporting this in the future, but in the meantime, we encourage customers to not send instant transfers through CashApp.Instead, when going through the flow in CashApp, the application will allow you to set up an instant transfer to your NorthOne card, however the funds will take the same amount of time as a standard transfer 1-3 business days and CashApp will still charge the instant fee.Because of this, we suggest linking your bank account instead of your card going forward, and only using the free standard transfer method to avoid incurring fees.As for loading cash on your card, NorthOne doesn’t charge any fees for cash loads. The additional ATM fees you may experience are charged by 3rd party ATMs or ATM owners.We do apologize if your NorthOne experience so far is not what you had hoped for, but we are very open to your feedback and appreciate you taking the time to leave us a review.

Sign up was painful as their website is consistently very slow and when I needed help getting the account setup neither phone nor chat help was available. I eventually got the account set up with email assistance and was immediately smacked with their $10 fee. As I had just opened the account and was not feeling great about the experience so far I requested the $10 fee be waived for that first month. They apparently really like their $10 more than they do clients because they adamantly refused after repeated requests. I found every interaction with this company and its employees to be disappointing and am not at all surprised at the overwhelming number of negative reviews.

"NorthOne","1 out of 5","Terrible customer support, shady practice","Amber Shoun","I am a newer customer. I am an independent contractor but I also own a side business making clothing. I am paid in cash for this as i usually get my business through word of mouth and set up at local flea markets on the weekends. When I signed up, I used someone’s referral link and was supposed to get a $75 bonus when I added my first $50. That was over a week ago. Support has been completely unhelpful and now have suspended my account because I have tried to get this issue resolved through about 5 different support agents. I have submitted my license, a photo of me with license, I don’t have typical invoices but have copies of receipts I’ve made out to customers. I’ve also offered a tax transcript to show I filed partial self employment last year. I just find this unbelievable that they offer a $75 bonus and don’t want to give it that badly to the point they would suspend my account. I would definitely rethink getting an account with them.","November 16, 2021","2021-11-16","Nov 19, 2021","Hi Amber, Thanks so much for taking the time to leave us a review.

You may get $75 using a referral code but they find a way to make that back in fees when your stream is slow. I’m STILL in the startup stages of my business and this stupid company stole $20 from me today off the basis that I’m paying for “the ability to use features” that don’t even exist y’all lol it’s still staying COMING SOON next to most features in the app. I wasn’t using the account but being charged for it? Make that make sense. You DO NOT tell people about the $10 fee until the account has been created don’t lie!! They don’t connect to most Stripe or Plaid Accounts and they don’t connect to Zelle or anything to get your money off the card before they charge you fees on top of fees. If I’d have known they were this scandalous I’d have never opened an account because now I’m stuck with only $7 to my name and can’t even afford diapers for my daughter.

Their support number doesn't work. They don't answer messages, tweets, Facebook comments, etc. Just today, I received an email stating they closed my account. I called Radius Bank, who is partnered with NorthOne, and they confirmed my account is still open, in good standing, and that I can still use my account. The rep on the phone also hinted at the fact that NorthOne is awful, but couldn't directly say it. How on earth can a ""bank"" not have any line of communication with customers, lock them out of their accounts for weeks, offer no transparency with ""updates"", and act like everything is fine. NorthOne can get bent. I've filed complaints with the BBB and the Federal Reserve. DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH THEM!Edit: Their reply to me is a fat lie.

My funds were frozen and I was locked out my account. I received an email from Northone stating ""We have decided to suspend your account until an account review is completed."" I was told I needed to submit a questionnaire, invoices explaining my business, and information on my other bank accounts in order to continue to use their services. The bank had been fully aware of my line of business for more than a year after signing up and I operated my account the same way until this day. According to them this is something ""all financial services companies do"". No other bank has ever attempted this that I have dealt with. It was not until I threatened them with legal action that they immediately unlocked my account.Numerous payments that I had tied to my account were missed causing me to work over the weekend to rectify the situation and use my other bank accounts that I thankfully had for my business. Judging by complaints here on BBB this has happened recently to many of their customers. I have no desire to do business with this bank especially with their services being offered through the The Bancorp Bank Holding Company which is being sued by investors for similar liquidity issues that recently brought down Silicon Valley Bank.","March 17, 2023","2023-03-23","Mar 23, 2023","Hi Terrance,All financial service companies are required to evaluate their products, services and customers periodically.

It seems that a couple of entrepreneurs decided to develop an online banking platform with Radius Bank providing the actual services. Interesting concept - but, it doesn't work. Customer service SUCKS. They closed my account by sending an email. No explanation except, ""The decision to exit your relationship is based on the overall evaluated risk, and not necessarily a reflect of you, or your account.We're sorry for the impact this decision may have on you, but the decision to close your account is final.Please do ensure you've transferred all your funds out of the account before April 13th, otherwise you will receive the remaining balance by check to your mailing address."" Stay away from NorthOne.UPDATE - It took a few weeks for NorthOne to respond with the typical corporate message. I did absolutely nothing to deserve the closure of my account. These app developers have no clue what personalized customer service means. If they did care about customer service, someone would call me to explain why they closed my account. Instead, they have a lawyer and a public relations writer respond to my critical review. NorthOne is not worth your business.","April 02, 2021","2021-05-02","May 2, 2021","Hi there, We understand the closure of your account is frustrating and not what you expected when you opened up a NorthOne account.

"NorthOne","1 out of 5","Stay away from this ""bank""!!!","Brian Turner","Stay away from this ""bank""!!!! BTW they are not a bank. They are a financial technology company ...essentially an app. You cant call anyone, you have to make an appointment thru the app and generally appointments are not available the same day. I opened this account, made a cash deposit to open. Then made a check deposit to test the system out ( for hold times etc). They immediately rejected the check ( no reason given) -cash was fine thou- and locked the account! Now the cash deposit is not available for withdrawal. they sent an email to answer alot of questions about my business. People, one of the questions was how do we get clients? - are you kidding me!!? Um, none of your business. They charged the 10.00 fee immediately upon depositing the cash . This appears to be a scam to charge a fee. My guess is they will hold the cash deposit and will finish ""the review"" after they charge more fees against the cash deposit. I only deposited 100.00 cash - which is now frozen. Imagine if you deposited a larger amount and then they just decide to block the account and its next to impossible to speak to someone. STAY AWAY. or your money could be frozen for no apparent reason and then they will ask you to answer 100 questions ( personal questions) about your business. Almost like they would then use the info for other purposes. Very sketchy. NORTHONE I would suggest you unblock the account or you'll spend your time doing damage control on posts like these.","November 04, 2022","2022-11-04","Nov 15, 2022","Hi Brian, Thank you for taking the time to reach out to us here.

After having the account for a few weeks, I can no longer login and then I get an email saying the acct is under review on 8/27. Now 2 weeks later, the same scripted reply that the account is under review. No one with a business can tolerate blocked access to their business banking account for days, let alone weeks. I think that NorthOne is a functioning scam and the positive reviews can't be real at all.UPDATE: Its now 3 months later and not one word from NorthOne on the status of their review or my account. So this just further shows the kind of company NorthOne is. They have kept the account locked for over 3 months. They have failed to communicate anything to me, but they have no problem with spamming me with 3rd party deals. Any inquiry to them generates the same pre-made email about how the security of their customers is their primary concern, which is quite rich because it looks to me like their customers are inconsequential to them and they are only protecting themselves. What from, you ask? No way to know, they won't share any info with their ""customer"" a.k.a. guinea pig for whatever scam they are running. This is not a made-up review; everything I have said is based on exactly what they have done.

They will make it so difficult to get proper help and will disregard your inquiries or any concerns. They will scam, do not trust them.It took time for my account to get set up and for my card to be received and I asked that the month not start until everything was ready and finalized but they went on charging me.  I didn't like the services and the lack support and perks they offered so I asked them to stop charging me per month and close my account at this point.They instead have continued to charge me per month and have drained the account even though I asked to to stop and close my account. There customer support is practically non existent and it feels as if they are trained to avoid you instead of help you. Imagine that!!!  I have been trying to reach customer service through their online chat portal and have no luck. It takes an hour to get connected then to send one message. I also looked for their phone support and have gotten nowhere. Nonexistent!They are so beyond ridiculous and deserve negative starts not even one star. I expect them to read this and fix this terrible experience or I will file a complain and not just a review.:This is a follow up edit on the review after NorthOne decided to respond.:I clearly asked on April 29th to stop getting charged fees. I did not receive any reply or help for that request. NorthOne are conveniently making themselves seem like they did the right thing and I have emails showing that to be a lie. Nice try but I stand by my review and am disgusted by NorthOne services and lies. Be ashamed of yourselves.

We are sorry to hear you have not had a positive experience with NorthOne. I see that you reached out to our team on April 29th, one month after opening your account, on March 29th, about being charged the first monthly fee, of which is agreed upon paying when you sign up. Our team let you know that this fee is standard and you did not continue the conversation. You reached out again June 24th stating you never got a reply and that your card came very late after sign up, when our team comfirmed with you that the card was activated 5 business days after account opening, as expected. During this outreach you shared that you wanted to close your account, at which point our team closed it for you. However, the fees already incurred would not be returned, as agreed upon in your signup.I also understand you mention it was difficult to get ahold of our team, however our typical response time during business hours is less than 10 min to get a reply and we are open 7 days a week to assist customers via chat and email. You can also schedule a call 7 days a week through your NorthOne application.

They are a scam","Kevin","My account has been locked for 48 hours. I have not been able to talk to a person nor gotten any responses to the 8 emails I have sent to ""customer support"" I DO NOT recommend trusting NorthOne with your small business banking. I will never use an online only bank again. Its been a terrible experience and not worth $15/month in banks fees I was going to save. If you want access to your funds DO NOT trust NorthOne with them. They are liars, they replied once on Facebook that they emailed me. I guess its somewhat true I got 4 emails asking me to refer new customers to them. But 0 emails or communication regarding my locked account or their outright ignoring me for 48 hours. They will steal your money for no reason and ignore your attempts to contact them. On a side note its probably not great marketing to ask for referrals from someone you just stole money from and are now ignoring. But I did listen and have been giving feedback about how they stole my money are now ignoring me to anyone looking for a new bank. **** I deposited a business check from a fortune 500 company into my business checking account. 5 days after locking account they now want me to prove that check was actually paid to me. They want invoices, They asked how I got the check, like did I find it and randomly try cashing it? It's written to my business from a business there is no suspicious activity. Yet they come at me as though I stole the check and am cashing a check that isn't mine. More so than ever I believe NorthOne is a scam and out to hurt small business. DO NOT trust them with your money. I have no idea how long it will take me to prove my businesses money is mine and get it back. They will ignore you and make you jump through circus hoops to prove your money is yours.***** I still do not recommend NorthOne, my entire experience was terrible and their random locking of accounts for illegitimate and illegal reasons can destroy a small business. I received my check for the funds in my were in my account via 2 day UPS so they can get your money back to you in a timely manner. If you make enough noise. I commented on the CEO's linkedin page and posted public comments on facebook posts to finally get them responding to me.

They have been patient and professional. My account was set quickly after a few more inquiries. I still feel that should have a customer service number for inquiring potential customers. But, they were so quick to respond to my concerns that maybe they don't?  I've changed my reviews from 1 star to 5.---------------------------------------------------I applied with two different online business banks, and one of them was NorthOne. I never heard back from them until I attempted to login to check and see if I could find out the status. Once logged in, they directed me to the option to make a deposit. So maybe they did approve my account?? I went through the deposit process and got the message that they needed to verify more information and that should be completed in 24 hours. That took 3 additional days.They have a number (332) 205-9253, and when you call it, it tells you to either make an appointment with a customer rep or email customer service.  I emailed them, and long story short, because my email wasn't the same as the one I applied with, they couldn't answer any questions. I explained the email that applied with was an alias to my business email address, and that I'd be happy to provide any other information they needed, or can I please talk to someone.  I was told the number is for customers only and that I need to email them from the email address that I applied for the account with.  I was frustrated. First, I waited days to get a reply. Then, when I logged in, I found that they were ready for me to go to the next step which was make a deposit -- only to be told that I will need to wait an additional 24 hours for whatever else they needed to verify... The 24 hours turned into 72. So, I needed to call my hosting company to get my email name changed, which I did. convoluted Once I did that, I called and requested they terminate the application.

"NorthOne","1 out of 5","Steer Clear of this Shady Business!","John Megowan","Based on my experience thus far, NorthOne is shady, at best, and a total fraud, at worst. I signed up thinking this would be a great banking app for my marketing needs. Deposited $50 and a few hours later, they suspended my account. Asked me to provide supporting documentation, which I did. Today, they closed my account with no reason as to why. They haven't responded to my replies, and it appears they're attempting to keep my $50 deposit as there was no mention of returning it to me in their correspondence. I also acquired referral signups but they appear not to be honoring those, either.Update after NorthOne's reply: I've received this same canned response AFTER I made several attempts to find out why they pulled a ""bait and switch"" routine. NorthOne has offered nothing new in this canned reply. In fact, they offered even less today. In their replies to me after I repeatedly asked them for an explanation, they refused to give me specifics as to why they closed my account after accepting my deposit and approving my account. They sent me a link to their referral terms/conditions, which they just modified last week to state ""you can refer to close, personal friends and family only."" Meanwhile, NorthOne advertises their signup/referral bonuses on sites such as Swagbucks, so there's no reason to believe that referring their promotion is something they did not want. What's clear is that NorthOne DID NOT want to honor their signup or referral bonus offerings, as they duped countless people - myself included - into applying for an account and depositing $50, and then suspended and closed the accounts.. Meanwhile, they now have copies of my driver's license, my SSN and other sensitive information.NorthOne claims to have sent me a check after I repeatedly inquired about it. I asked for proof of this and they have yet to provide me any proof, and I have still not received a check.Update 11/17/21 - It's been 8 days since NorthOne told me they were sending me a check to refund the $50 I deposited when signing up. I haven't received the check, and I asked about it this morning, to which ""Paulie"" replied, ""we advise that you please review the Account Agreement from here.""Update 5/31/22 - I finally received my check weeks after having to demand it from Northone.  I truly believe they would've kept my deposit had I not fought tooth-and-nail to get it back.  I also found that my original review back in November was removed, and they've got several suspicious 5-star reviews which I believe are from employees.  There's also one 3-star review and their reply encouraged the reviewer to change it to 5-star.  Shady and desperate.  Despite them seemingly trying to stack the deck with fake 5-star reviews, the 1-star genuine reviews are still coming in on this company's shady business practices.Based on my experience, I strongly warn against doing business with this awful company.Update 6/4/22 - The reply they gave to this is the same canned reply they gave on my original review, which they somehow got removed, hence this re-review.  I spent weeks going back and forth with them via email.  Out of all the people I spoke to, there was only one rep who was actually apologetic over the situation and professional.  All the others were as ridiculous as their reply to this review is.","May 31, 2022","2022-06-04","Jun 2, 2022","Hi there, Our sincere apologies for the trouble.

"NorthOne","1 out of 5","Sketchy business! Do NOT Recommend","Christina Isom","So I’m an online marketer/freelancer that partakes and earns income from multiple opportunities online, referring to family/friends. I joined this app a few days ago to use and refer to others as well; they were running a $75 referral bonus for each successful person who signs up and deposits $50. So I joined and followed those instructions and received a few sign ups. Then the next day I was emailed that my account was suspended til I could provide documentation about my business and answer some of their questions. Inconvenience considering my account was accepted already, but I did as they requested and provided my information, answered their questions, and sent payment proof that I do earn income online from my business and sent some social media links so they could see exactly what it is I do (even though I did explain) Fast forward to Today, my account is closed & I can’t access the app/login and the person I’ve been speaking to hasn’t provided me any legitimate reason as to WHY my account was closed. Like she doesn’t care; I had to mention I was going to the BBB (which I am) if I don’t receive my money! Only then after mentioning that, did she say they would mail me a check! I’m awaiting her response as of now… not sure if the check is only for my deposit or for my sign on bonus/referral pay as well. Because she didn’t mention so. Support is BAD. (At least with this woman it is) Us marketers know each other, we talk. This is unfair treatment, sketchy, stealing, & bad business. We did the work; least they could do is honor their referral program and pay us. So that’s why I give NorthOne Bank a 1 star.UPDATE 11/12/2021, after NorthOne’s reply: I received the exact same response from y’all that other’s have received; y’all have provided no additional info, simply copying & pasting scripts to everyone to make yourself seem professional, however still not answering our concerns as to why y’all are shutting down accounts left & right and not paying people what’s due to them; this is not good business! (PS, that link… yall modified last week AFTER I & others joined… stating, “you can refer to close, personal family and friends only” which is what I do!) So either way, I followed your rules, yet y’all don’t wanna honor your own referral program! That’s sad. Y’all ‘tricked’ a bunch of people, including myself, into joining & depositing $50 and then turn around and suspend & eventually shut down our accounts, AFTER we submit to y’all personal/sensitive info like our driver’s license and ssn! If that’s not suspicious I don’t know what is. Also! Y’all claim to have sent me a check (which I have not received & I’m still waiting on) And y’all haven’t even responded back to my email where I request a photo copy of the check (cause I wasn’t told how much the check would be for) and tracking. ? So I can send y’all details that y’all claim you need to help reinstate my account (tho y’all closed it)!! but y’all can’t send me proof of sending my check? What BS. Seems one sided, don’t it? (For anyone reading this) I do NOT recommend trying NorthOne. Most people, including myself, are displeased!- I did file a claim with the BBB.","November 11, 2021","2021-11-12","Nov 12, 2021","Hello Christina,Thank you for reaching out here.

"NorthOne","1 out of 5","North One will scam you if you refer others","Olga Barradas","I signed up for NorthOne about a month ago.  All was going well until I was notified one day that my referral link had been removed and more information was requested about my business.  Confused about this I replied back to NorthOne that I had already provided the requested information during sign up and was only told, ""All banks occasionally review customer accounts..."".  I still found this odd, but complied with their request and provided the requested information the next day.  After I provided the information, I was told ""Your referral link has been removed and will not be reactivated"" in spite of me providing everything they asked for.  When I inquired why I was being treated with such disdain and accusatory nature, the support only replied that they could not tell me why my link was revoked, and simply referred me to their terms of service.  I read over the terms and nothing in them applied to me in any way.  This occurred after I referred two people who are also small business owners to the bank.  It appears they removed my link so that they would not have to pay the referral bonuses.  Having not broke ANY of their rules or terms this is the only logical explanation. I've never in my life seen such scamming tactics utilized by a legitimate bank.  It's shameful.edit: After reading some of the other reviews, I feel slightly better to know that I wasn't singled out and that  NorthOne is just an awful scam ridden bank.  I find it amusing they have this canned response:""All financial service companies are required to evaluate their products, services and customers periodically."" (I also received this response when engaging with customer service via email).My Lili small business banking account has never treated me this way so they can keep this awful canned response to themselves.","July 19, 2022","2022-07-19","Jul 22, 2022","Hello Olga, Thank you for your outreach.
