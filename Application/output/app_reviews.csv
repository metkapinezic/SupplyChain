0,1117,Asicminertech,"I only barely escaped with my money because of glóbalfundrètrival company. They come across as extremely professional. There are some very good reviews on various UK sites but they're a total scam. They pretend to help you invest in crypto and show you the results of your deposits and profits on their fake webpage prime-coin.info. Whatever you put in will not come back out even if you pay the 20% ""withdrawal"" fee that the fake Blockchain advises is for regulatory purposes."
1,1117,Asicminertech,"FAKE SCAM!  I got scammed out of several thousand dollars. Domain is registered in ICELAND, Just check ICANN domain registration site, it's registered to this address: Kalkofnsvegur 2, Reykjavik, Capital Region, 101, ISI have a friend that lives in Florida and she went by the address, and NOPE no business there. The guy is an Indian or Chinese, not sure which, but not an American. LIAR THIEF, CHEAT, he will rot in HELL!"
2,1117,Asicminertech,"Horrible scammers, you will loose your bitcoin, don't fall for this scammer, FAKE not trustworthy.  Please report your money lost to FTC, IC3 and the website host provider.

3,1117,Asicminertech,"As the internet shopping becomes more and more widely spread throughout the world as an idea, the frauds occur more and more often. I thought im immune to financial traps but it seems i am not, this site proves it. I payed and didn't receive anything. I hope no one else get in my position, so choose wisely before sending money to an online shop!"
4,1117,Asicminertech,"THIS IS 100% A SCAM!!I called the telephone number and a guy that sounded like he just woke up picked the phone up, and I told him i'm in the area and would like to buy and pickup an ASIC miner. He hung the phone up immediately.Also contacted a real business in the same address location and there are no businesses in the vicinity that sells anything like tech/ hardware.The website was created a month ago, and also has way too many English grammatical errors."
5,1117,Asicminertech,"This is a total scam. Please stay away from this website. We’re taking legal action against this company. If anyone else is interested in being a part please contact +1 (860) 212-3808. We were told our product would arrived a week after depositing the money, never received the product. Total scam."
6,1117,Asicminertech,"NO NO NO NO NO. FAKE SCAM! The reviews below were written by the scammers from this website. DO NOT SEND YOUR CRYPTO, it will be gone forever! Don't be a fool like me, I lost thousands. There is no real company at the florida address. When I asked for a refund they wanted another $300 to process it. Imagine that!  Domain is registered in ICELAND. FAKE FRAUD, SCAM LIARS THIEFS, foreigners on VPN creating fake sites raking in THOUSANDS. BEWARE!"
7,1117,Asicminertech,"The ease and endless selection of online shopping is growing, but you need to not forget to take precautions to make sure you get what you pay for and not being scammed like i let this site to do with me. I was careless and didn't follow the signs to make sure its not legit."
8,1117,Asicminertech,My experience with this site is i liked a product which i payed in advance and it's been third month waiting and still nothing is delivered to me. I was careless. If i remember well there was a quote - if something is too good to be true then it probably is! Fraud
9,1117,Asicminertech,"Trusting asicminertech.com and ordering from there, like i did, will lead to losing your money and you will not get the product, because they don't deliver ! Scam!"
10,1117,Asicminertech,"At first i was totally sure that i want to order from this company, but it turned out to be a scam! My advice to all of you is not to trust them, because the products i ordered were already paid, but nothing came at all."
11,1117,Asicminertech,Don't fall for their virtual fraud trap like i did! Be smarter than me and rethink twice before ordering from here! SCAM SITE !!
12,1117,Asicminertech,"I see your company's rating and i thought i could trust you, but i was wrong  ~! I can't imagine that a certain product travels 4 weeks until  now .. Maby it will turn out to be a scam."
13,1117,Asicminertech,"Fraudsters are in the shadows, they’re constantly finding new ways to commit theft online and improving, adapting and changing their techniques, based on the recent SCAM success!"
14,1117,Asicminertech,If you buy from here you can say goodbye to your cash. Fraudsters !!! If you order from here they will not send anything in return!
15,1117,Asicminertech,"I really wanted this to not be a scam, but everything points to the opposite, because i ordered 5 weeks ago and i'm still waiting! Fraud for sure!"
16,1117,Asicminertech,Well I didn't do enough research and just got scammed. It's the boys from INDIA at it again.  I may have to hunt them down and kill them. I have friends in the India that can help. The fun begins.

23,1113,cryptobaseatm.com,I have been using Cryptobase ATM machines for over 3 years now. All of them are safe and secure which makes me feel comfortable using them every time. I appreciate all of their support when I was having trouble with my wallet
24,1113,cryptobaseatm.com,Cryptobase is the only name I trust when I am looking to buy crypto currencies like bitcoin with cash. 5 stars without a doubt
25,1112,NorthOne,Very happy with NorthOne so far. I started my company a few months ago and it was so hard to open an account with my local banks. They’re constantly releasing new features ( Revenue features is awesome with Amazon!) and improving the app. Much appreciated guys!
26,1112,NorthOne,Northone is the ideal business banking account for entrepreneurs just starting out. The services are great.
27,1112,NorthOne,Decent online bank. The most useful tool is  the ability to email n1 and have invoices immediately paid. reduces the amount of work I put into accounting
28,1112,NorthOne,Good bank. Easy to use and the customer support team is very responsive.
29,1112,NorthOne,I love this bank. I do wish they bring back the debit card deposits. I'm in a wheelchair and it's difficult at time for me to get to payment locations to make deposits. Other than that yiu are perfect for our business.
30,1112,NorthOne,Their invoice system said “free forever” but then they suddenly shut it down and locked me out.  They are refusing to give me my lost account information.  The person I emailed with did not give a you know what about me or my business.  Why would anyone trust these people with their money if they can’t even preserve your account information
31,1112,NorthOne,"Startup that is great for small business growth. Easy-to-use and reliable.  Customer Support responds by Chat and secure email. Bonuses added periodically just for use. Not reward points but real money and additional $75 for new account referrals. Did someone say ""free money""?"
32,1112,NorthOne,"Mostly awesome!!!  Two change that would really help: (1) I'd like for the Deposit Account to show an account balance column on the right as all banks have this; (2) I'd like to see the account history for Deposit Account and folders in a page-by-page view instead of continuous scroll. Sometimes it takes a long time to scroll to where I need to get. Yes, I know there is a Filter option. However, all banks I know of give a paging option. E.g., options to: (a) view x number of transactions per page; (b) at bottom of page provide page number links 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 etc. THANK YOU!!! :)"
33,1112,NorthOne,"Last month they started ""upgrading"" accounts. Ever since then, I've been locked out of my account for weeks. Their support number doesn't work. They don't answer chat messages or emails anymore. How on earth can a ""bank"" not have any line of communication with customers, lock them out of their accounts for weeks, offer no transparency with ""updates"", and act like everything is fine. For weeks they have been telling me the update would be complete and that access would be regained. I've filed complaints with the BBB and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Highly advise not opening an account at NorthOne."
34,1112,NorthOne,I was recommended NorthOne and I am glad I opened up my new account with them. They met me where I needed the most and provided me exceptional customer services and made me feel like family. Im looking forward to the many benefits they can offer for my business. Wil continue to recommend.
35,1112,NorthOne,"North one has been fair to me. Their customer service works quite efficiently, every person I have spoken to has treated me well. I would take half of a star out because they are not fully integrated with Zelle yet, however the platform seems to be improving over time."
36,1112,NorthOne,NorthOne is perfect for running an online business (I run an etsy store). Great integrations with etsy
37,1112,NorthOne,"I sure wish I had known before I opened the account that North One doesn't accept instant transfers from Cashapp, PayPal, Etc. What a ripoff this account is prepaid, like Green Dot prepaid and we're still being charged a monthly fee! It feels so cheap and weird to load funds onto a ""business debit"" at the local 7-Eleven and to be charged $4.95 to do so. I'm going back to regular banking. Thanks but no thanks."
38,1112,NorthOne,"I opened an account last year, received a touting and account number, I went to deposite money, the account said invalid, no online details, and the app does Not work. I did not receive notice of any cancellation nor did customer service help. Thank god I never put a lot of money in there. They ought to be ashamed of themselves for even promoting their sorry, fraudulent, theiving company STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!"
39,1112,NorthOne,Northone CLOSES MY ACC 2 DAYS AFTER OPENING IT . ALL MY BUSINESS MONEY IS STUCK BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS PHONE NUMBER DOES NOT WORK THIS IS A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BANK DONT BANK WITH THEMBY THE WAY BEEN UPLOADED DOCUMENTS SHOWING FULL BUSSINESS PROOF
40,1112,NorthOne,"They have kept me from access to my account for more than 11, going on possibly 22 days now (after fighting and fighting to get any kind of straight answer). This business is not ethical or forth coming in their dealing. I strongly advise that you look at their BBB rating before deciding to tie your money up with them."
41,1112,NorthOne,"The opening process was really fast and easy but my issue is that i use Cashapp, paypal and venmo in my business and was not told they do not encourage people to transfer money from these into your account. I* transferred money instantly from Cashapp into my checking account and guess what? I have to wait to get my money 1-3 days. This should be told to your customers because some of us is still trying to transition from using these payment options"
42,1112,NorthOne,"so far my experience with NothOne has been good. The set up process took much longer than expected. However, when I reached out to ask questions your customer service department was quick to respond."
43,1112,NorthOne,"I see a lot of bad reviews on here but a lot of them seem to be during the banks’ upgrade, which was pretty well explained thru email on what to expect, so take them with a grain of salt. I was with NorthOne before and after upgrading and have had no issues."
44,1112,NorthOne,"If you are scammed by a company, paid for a product you never received,  dont expect this bank to help you retrieve your money. Expect to be out the money, the bank charges fees and the account has to be open to investigate a claim they never intend to pay but they know you will close your account immediately if they tell you your money is not safe, and you will receive no refund so they collect for 3 months and then hit you with ita a valid transaction.  Meanwhile the merchant closed shop and disconnected their phone number. Go to a real bank with real protection."
45,1112,NorthOne,Closed my account because I did not notify because of my travels. Also would not work with me on my balance and said it had to be send snail mail which took to weeks. Luckily I have accounts a Bank of America and Revolut. Worst experience constantly asking me for documents when all my money came from tops banks. Worst bank ever.
46,1112,NorthOne,Extremely disappointing all around. Sign up was painful as their website is consistently very slow and when I needed help getting the account setup neither phone nor chat help was available. I eventually got the account set up with email assistance and was immediately smacked with their $10 fee. As I had just opened the account and was not feeling great about the experience so far I requested the $10 fee be waived for that first month. They apparently really like their $10 more than they do clients because they adamantly refused after repeated requests. I found every interaction with this company and its employees to be disappointing and am not at all surprised at the overwhelming number of negative reviews. Should have read the reviews first.
47,1112,NorthOne,"The worst banking experience in my life.They closed my account for no reason.They just issued me one email saying my account would be closed. ""The decision to exit your relationship is based on the overall evaluated risk, and not necessarily a reflect of you, or your account.We're sorry for the impact this decision may have on you, but the decision to close your account is final.Please do ensure you've transferred all your funds out of the account before April 13th, otherwise you will receive the remaining balance by check to your mailing address.""Don't bother with this bank. Use Mercury instead. I've got 3 other banking accounts with them. Also Avanti is looking great."
48,1112,NorthOne,"Avoid this bank at all costs. For a small business, They allowed the account to remain open for months without any issues, then just emailed saying they are closing it with no explanation, but took their monthly fee first.As a small business this is a warning to other small businesses. Avoid this company Reply to the response:No they didn't communicate the reason at all. My point still stands.A message to any small business owner. Use a high street bank do not use these online digital private banks. In my 30 years of banking I have never had a brick and mortar banks close an account, Digital bank, 2 in the last 12 months.  The first one I am still waiting for the funds to be released"
49,1112,NorthOne,love the live chat support with american customer service reps. huge plus. Prompt and knowledgeable assistance.
50,1112,NorthOne,ARE YOU KIDDING THAT RESPONSE WAS  I TRANSFERRED MONEY OUT OF MY SQUARE ACCT TO NORTHONE IN THE AMOUNT OF 422.08 ON JUL 11 ON JUL 15 YOULL CLOSE MY ACCT THAT MONEY WAS NEVER RETURN TO ME SO NOW YOU ARE TELLING A LIE I CAN SHOW THAT UP TO JUL 15 I DEPOSITED OVER 900 FROM MY SQUARE ACCT IF I COULD UPLOAD THE TRANSFER RECEIPT THAT I HAVE I WOULD SHOW YOU SOMEONE WHOS STUPID AND DONT KNOW I HAD MONEY IN THAT ACCT
51,1112,NorthOne,This bank account is perfect for my Etsy business! The Etsy integration allows me to get my Etsy Payments directly into my NorthOne business account! I love how easy and convenient it is. Thank you for saving me hours of manually transferring from Etsy to my account.
52,1112,NorthOne,Ethan was an awesome Customer Rep. He assisted me with getting my bank replacement card. Very professional phone etiquette.I give him the highest ratings.
53,1112,NorthOne,"NorthOne rejected my valid SBA deposit last week and closed my account because, I asked them why? My employees Healthcare/Dental is now cancelled and my Business is going to go under. Not because of the SBA or anything, I did. Because NorthOne, rejected a valid Government issued deposit.NorthOne Upgraded their systems recently and the electronic audit trail showing this blatant disregard for US Banking Laws will be revealed in Court and Online."
54,1112,NorthOne,"My account got approved 3 minutes after my submitted my applicationCrazy fast I was not expecting that, and so good to experience such a great onboarding process. Coming from Azlo I had very high expectations, and I must say NorthOne did not disappoint."
55,1112,NorthOne,Owning a restaurant means endless hours on my feet and the last thing I want to do is spend time standing in line at the bank. This has removed that issue from my life and I honestly couldn’t be happier. Do you know how great it is banking from the couch??
56,1112,NorthOne,NorthOne has been awesome for my business. Setting up my business checking account with them was extremely easy and user-friendly. I'm a proud customer of NorthOne Bank. I highly recommend them to all business owners.
57,1112,NorthOne,"I was nervous to apply with this bank that I have never heard of before, but the referral i got came from a very trusted youtuber that I’ve been following for years so I decided to give it a try and I am so glad that i did.They used northone for their business and I started using it for mine and I am so happy with the features."
58,1112,NorthOne,"Honestly, this is not the bank especially for a small business. It's been the absolute worst experience. I received an email requesting my business information for an ""upgrade,"" it wasn't an upgrade it was to review accounts. That's fine, but when I contacted them regarding my account being locked they couldn't tell me what was going on, then they closed it, while I was talking to them and told me I would receive the funds in my account in the next week. I also had a transfer from square that day and was told by them oh it will just bounce back- weeks later when it didn't happen they magically found it.  It's a month later- just don't do it. The phone number doesn't work. I still do not have my funds."
59,1112,NorthOne,This bank does not deserve one star. I'm trying to move my companies money to my companies savings account and they are giving me an extremely hard time. It seems they want to keep your money hostage.
60,1112,NorthOne,"Had a problem getting my bonuses and when it didn’t hit on time I contacted them and was immediately funded without any issues. Fast reliable, and worth it all."
61,1112,NorthOne,I don't recommend banking with NorthOne.  I had a shaky experience opening the account and an even worse experience closing it (which I'm still in the process of 3 months later).  Go to a legitimate bank.
62,1112,NorthOne,"I am a newer customer. I am an independent contractor but I also own a side business making clothing. I am paid in cash for this as i usually get my business through word of mouth and set up at local flea markets on the weekends. When I signed up, I used someone’s referral link and was supposed to get a $75 bonus when I added my first $50. That was over a week ago. Support has been completely unhelpful and now have suspended my account because I have tried to get this issue resolved through about 5 different support agents. I have submitted my license, a photo of me with license, I don’t have typical invoices but have copies of receipts I’ve made out to customers. I’ve also offered a tax transcript to show I filed partial self employment last year. I just find this unbelievable that they offer a $75 bonus and don’t want to give it that badly to the point they would suspend my account. I would definitely rethink getting an account with them."
63,1112,NorthOne,"I run a full time bakery and have been selling vintage furniture on Etsy on the side for 6 years and NorthOne makes it super simple to keep track of both my payroll and second income with the sub accounts option, and I can integrate it directly with Etsy which is amazing. I switched over from Bank of America and was previously going between the Bank of America app and the Etsy shop owner application, now I just use NorthOne for everything!!"
64,1112,NorthOne,"Stay away - they will close your account for no reason, and then keep your $. I sent $10,000 ACH out of the account, next day they closed my account & they canceled the ACH that was sent a day early. This is the excuse they gave me:""The Money has been returned to your account on our end regarding that transaction as the transaction didn't go through. On our end, it looks like the transaction didn't go through for insufficient funds. That being said, I do see that funds were present in the account at the time of it being sent.""So I am stuck without being able to pay my vendor, and now need to wait 30 days to receive ""check"" in the mail - even though all reviews say that checks cannot be cashed.Run away."
65,1112,NorthOne,"Suspended my account AFTER I told them I was closing the account. Went to transfer out my initial deposit through ach and it failed. Received  an email stating all kinds of information needed to reopen account. Do not want to reopen the account, I want my initial deposit that NorthOne deemed acceptable with initial verification process. Will be filing a complaint with regulatory offices."
66,1112,NorthOne,"Best Business bank ever. I made the switch from PayPal and CashApp and haven’t looked back since, keeping all my money in one place has been super helpful, and no more interest payments with PayPal. Thank you NorthOne."
67,1112,NorthOne,"COMPLETE SCAM. I attempted to open a checking account with this fintech back in 2020 during the beginning of the Pandemic. I came here and saw the reviews. They opened an account and I did not deposit a dime and did not use the account. I complained on this site. They promised to close my account. So what did I get today in my inbox? AN OVERDRAFT NOTIFICATION!  How is it that on this very site they promised to close my account but now that the heat is off they crawl back trying to demand money from me?  My instinct were right and now I'm contacting Senator Schumer's office and NY Attorney General's office to open an investigation on this criminal racket.ETA: I just git this:Hello there,You recently received an overdraft email from us in error. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.If you have an open NorthOne Account: you can always check your balance by logging into your account on the NorthOne app or website.Please let us know if you require further information,The NorthOne Customer Care Team–Banking services provided by The Bancorp Bank; Member FDIC."
68,1112,NorthOne,Massive improvements. Seems like the product is evolving very quickly. Looking forward to seeing what's in store.
69,1112,NorthOne,I wish I could give NEGATIVE starts. I’ve had Northone for 2 years with only minor issues. Until now…I woke up this morning to find out my account had been locked. It’s at this time I came to find out there is no way to call or use a chat function to reach them. You have to EMAIL. I’ve sent three so far. And NOTHING. I can’t access the thousands in my account for my business. With no communication and no explanation. Insanity. I’ve now seen HUNDREDS of complaints from other consumers. This bank is SHADY AF! Getting ready to go purchase the domain name: northonescam.com
70,1112,NorthOne,"This bank was referred to me by someone I consider highly creditable. But when I signed up thats as far as i got. They sent me a letter which didnt really tell me anything. Now I know my credit is good so thats not the problem. I call the State to make sure all my Info was viewable so thats not the problem.  Im more legit that any other industry in existence AMAZONS NOT GOING OUT OF BUSINESS ANYTIME SOON AND DROPSHIPPING IS JUST GETTING STARTED SO GET USED TO IT. NOW 36% OF THE REVIEWS WERE NEGATIVE AND MANY REMOVE BECAUSE OF NO REPLY FROM THE REVIEWER. I WILL MAKE SURE I TELL MY REFERRER NOT TO SEND ANY MORE YOUR WAY.  NOT TO MENTION IF I CANT TALK TO A HUMAN I REALLY DONT LIKE DOING BUSINESS LIKE THAT ANY WAY. SO JUST LIKE MY REFERRER ALSO SAID, IWILL TAKE THAT PIECE OF ADVICE .................. KEEP IT LOCAL."
71,1112,NorthOne,I think this bank is great. They have exceptional customer service it's like your texting with a friend and they are always right there to help you at any hour any time. I love it. So friendly and it seems like they really do care about you. That's a far cry from what I have dealt with recently. So time to shut down all my other accounts because I'm going straight Northone. Excited for the new features can't wait. Time to deposit all funds and make the leap. :)]
72,1112,NorthOne,"I’ve tried to establish an account with them. I sent them my articles of incorporation and drivers license and they responded with the following. The decision to decline your application for an account could be due to one or more reasons, including but not limited to: the inability to verify your identity and/or business based on the information you provided, a particularly high risk type of business, an unsupported industry, or information provided from 3rd party vendors. It’s the pet industry. Every third person has a dog or cat they either need supplies or a hood hair cut. The process is confusing and I personally think they make their decisions on other unscrupulous factors."
73,1112,NorthOne,"DON’T OPEN ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK: THEY HAVE SEIZED AND REFUSED TO SEND THE BALANCE MONEY I HAVE IN MY ACCOUNT AFTER PROMISING THEY WILL SEND IT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW.0 Star Review:Someone sent money to pay for one of the cars I was selling. NorthOne seized the money, blocked my account, and asked for so many documents including ID cards from both me and the sender and a selfie of us holding our IDs to our face. It was humiliating but we took the selfies anyways and sent everything they asked for including all documents about the transaction. Yet they closed the account after being so rude and unprofessional in their messages to me. They then said they will email my balance money in the account to me, but it’s been months now and I still haven’t gotten my $3,000 in my account. I need that money desperately and there’s no way I can reach them. This is the worst experience I’ve had with any company."
74,1112,NorthOne,"Trashy company, would not recommend to anyone. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!! You may get $75 using a referral code but they find a way to make that back in fees when your stream is slow. I’m STILL in the startup stages of my business and this stupid company stole $20 from me today off the basis that I’m paying for “the ability to use features” that don’t even exist y’all lol it’s still staying COMING SOON next to most features in the app. I wasn’t using the account but being charged for it? Make that make sense. You DO NOT tell people about the $10 fee until the account has been created don’t lie!! They don’t connect to most Stripe or Plaid Accounts and they don’t connect to Zelle or anything to get your money off the card before they charge you fees on top of fees. If I’d have known they were this scandalous I’d have never opened an account because now I’m stuck with only $7 to my name and can’t even afford diapers for my daughter. Evil evil company, they refused to refund or credit me and definitely don’t deserve to be in business after this web of lies."
75,1112,NorthOne,"In April they began ""upgrading"" accounts. Ever since then, I've been locked out of my account for weeks. Their support number doesn't work. They don't answer messages, tweets, Facebook comments, etc. Just today, I received an email stating they closed my account. I called Radius Bank, who is partnered with NorthOne, and they confirmed my account is still open, in good standing, and that I can still use my account. The rep on the phone also hinted at the fact that NorthOne is awful, but couldn't directly say it. How on earth can a ""bank"" not have any line of communication with customers, lock them out of their accounts for weeks, offer no transparency with ""updates"", and act like everything is fine. NorthOne can get bent. I've filed complaints with the BBB and the Federal Reserve. DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH THEM!Edit: Their reply to me is a fat lie. They have not communicated with me further than the initial email and conveniently chose to not address the fact that Radius Bank, their partner, even stated that my account is still active and not closed. Kindly stop lying."
76,1112,NorthOne,"When I need help. Support is always thereMoving to an online bank was a switch for me but I am happy that the customer support has been great, it’s been reassuring."
77,1112,NorthOne,"I am highly disappointed in this bank and had high hopes for it. I am a freelancer and do all kinds of different jobs. As that was one of their options in opening an account with them. At first they approved my account. Then the next day I get an email asking for proof of my business and where I get my money from. I sent that in and their was no problem. I then the day after, get another email stating that they were closing my account but yet did not provide and answer as to why they were doing this. I wrote them back asking about my referral money because  I had also referred a few family and friends to their business and they were offering a $75 referral reward per person who was able to sign up with them. I am highly upset about the fact that they are now trying to send me a check for my $50 deposit for opening the account  but not including my referral incentives that I am owed. I will also be taking this to the BBB as well in hopes that’s maybe this won’t happen to another fellow freelancer or anyone else for that matter."
78,1112,NorthOne,The customer service was quick efficient and helpful. I couldn’t be happier. I wish more companies were better at customer service like North One bank!
79,1112,NorthOne,Horrible! This bank stole 500 from me.  They said that they would investigate fraud charges and that took 3 months and I kept calling them and they never sent me an email or letter to notify me of any progress. So I called them and they said oh we can’t see any problems and the 500.00 is not retrievable! Then they charged me 5.00 a day while my account was over drawn due to their negligence
80,1112,NorthOne,"This bank is a complete scam. I am almost baffled they could have any good reviews, I would read all of the bad reviews very carefully before you decide to put a dime in NorthOne, you have been warned. I opened my account June of last year with $50.00, a couple days later my account was locked and I could not get it unlocked. I have sent three customer service emails to NorthOne with zero response except an automated email every couple of weeks. Since then the bank has basically deducted all $50.00 out of my account and is now going backwards $5.00 a day so now its overdrawn, I don't know how much cause I'm locked out, hopefully tens of thousands of dollars lol. Its now almost a year later and I still get emails from them but with no response to my concerns except to let me know my locked account is overdrawn, great business model guys, would have preferred if you just closed it like you did to some other people on here. This bank is a joke, it doesn't even have a working customer service number, thats really all you need to know..."
81,1112,NorthOne,"DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH THIS COMPANY, buyer beware. I wrote a check from my personal account to Northone to fund my business. They sent the check to a third party company to cash. I waited and waited no money was deposited. Meanwhile they stopped using the 3rd party company. I’m still fighting to get my $4,500.00 back from them. They told me to work with the third party company to get my money back. You have to make an appointment to talk to an actual person, which takes about a week. They have email and chat that rarely works correctly. They do not have business checks. I feel they are shady and fraudulent for cashing my check then giving me the run around to try to track it down."
82,1112,NorthOne,"NorthOne is a poor excuse for a bank. Actually, they are not a bank - they are a front for Radius Bank. It seems that a couple of entrepreneurs decided to develop an online banking platform with Radius Bank providing the actual services. Interesting concept - but, it doesn't work. Customer service SUCKS. They closed my account by sending an email. No explanation except, ""The decision to exit your relationship is based on the overall evaluated risk, and not necessarily a reflect of you, or your account.We're sorry for the impact this decision may have on you, but the decision to close your account is final.Please do ensure you've transferred all your funds out of the account before April 13th, otherwise you will receive the remaining balance by check to your mailing address."" Stay away from NorthOne.UPDATE - It took a few weeks for NorthOne to respond with the typical corporate message. I did absolutely nothing to deserve the closure of my account. These app developers have no clue what personalized customer service means. If they did care about customer service, someone would call me to explain why they closed my account. Instead, they have a lawyer and a public relations writer respond to my critical review. NorthOne is not worth your business."
83,1112,NorthOne,they charge $10 a month for the honor of doing business with them. Customer service is adversarial. It takes forever and forget it if you want to talk to someone on the phone. I just closed my account because I ran out of Tums.

85,1112,NorthOne,The feature to connect to quickbooks accounting has been so helpful. I no longer have to manually input my banking data and account balances. Quickbooks automatically updates with my account balances.
86,1112,NorthOne,"On Friday March 17th 2023 I was notified without any prior warning or notice that my business bank account had been suspended. My funds were frozen and I was locked out my account. I received an email from Northone stating ""We have decided to suspend your account until an account review is completed."" I was told I needed to submit a questionnaire, invoices explaining my business, and information on my other bank accounts in order to continue to use their services. The bank had been fully aware of my line of business for more than a year after signing up and I operated my account the same way until this day. According to them this is something ""all financial services companies do"". No other bank has ever attempted this that I have dealt with. It was not until I threatened them with legal action that they immediately unlocked my account.Numerous payments that I had tied to my account were missed causing me to work over the weekend to rectify the situation and use my other bank accounts that I thankfully had for my business. Judging by complaints here on BBB this has happened recently to many of their customers. I have no desire to do business with this bank especially with their services being offered through the The Bancorp Bank Holding Company which is being sued by investors for similar liquidity issues that recently brought down Silicon Valley Bank."
87,1112,NorthOne,"04/25/2021 Unbelievable. They overdrafted my account my 3K. One day I was down 3K, the next morning it was back in my account, and the next day it disappeared again.  So I sent 3K in plus $700 to cover it. Now they are stonewalling me -- I can't get them on the phone, email, or customer support. I'm locked out of my account on app and web. I went to withdraw money using my debit card -- it says there is $5 in my account. For sure there is supposed to be $700 in my account. I sent it via Paypal, and Paypal has always been good to me. Plus there is the matter of this 3k. This has been a horrific, horrific experience. DO NOT BANK WITH THEM. I have moved to Citibank.To verify MY identity to see that I am telling the truth, visit my Instagram @iamsaraartist. I want these people put in prison for fraud and theft."
88,1112,NorthOne,IF I COULD RATE ZERO STARS I WOULD! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST POSSIBLE ONLINE BANK FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS!! I OPENED AN ACCOUNT A MONTH AGO AND LITERALLY JUST SUBMITTED MY FIRST MOBILE CHECK DEPOSIT! OUT OF THE BLUE THIS ASS CRACK OF A COMPANY CLOSED MY ACCOUNT AND LOCKED ME OUT OF MY ACCOUNT!!!!!!!!!! ALL WHILE THE CHECK IS IN PROCESS OF BEING CLEARED!!! HAD 4 MORE DAYS UNTIL FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE AND THEY ARE GIVING ME UNTIL 9/05 TO CLEAR OUT ANY BALANCES IN MY ACCOUNT! WELL HOW TF AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT WHEN MY ACCOUNT IS LOCKED! AND THEY MAKE IT HARD FOR ACCOUNT OWNERS TO CALL THEM OR CONTACT THEM!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!! THEY WILL LOCK YOUR MONEY AWAY WITH NO ACCESS TO THE FUNDS AND SUSPEND ALL POSSIBLE WAYS TO CLEAR YOUR ACCOUNT! I AM SO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE TOOK HEED TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS BEFORE I EVEN CONSIDERED THEM!!!! GO TO BLUEVINE OR ANY OTHER BANK! BUT NOT NORTHONE!! AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK FROM THE CHECK I DEPOSITED! YOU GUYS HAD NO REASON AT ALL TO SHUT MY ACCOUNT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
89,1112,NorthOne,"Stay away from this ""bank""!!!! BTW they are not a bank. They are a financial technology company ...essentially an app. You cant call anyone, you have to make an appointment thru the app and generally appointments are not available the same day. I opened this account, made a cash deposit to open. Then made a check deposit to test the system out ( for hold times etc). They immediately rejected the check ( no reason given) -cash was fine thou- and locked the account! Now the cash deposit is not available for withdrawal. they sent an email to answer alot of questions about my business. People, one of the questions was how do we get clients? - are you kidding me!!? Um, none of your business. They charged the 10.00 fee immediately upon depositing the cash . This appears to be a scam to charge a fee. My guess is they will hold the cash deposit and will finish ""the review"" after they charge more fees against the cash deposit. I only deposited 100.00 cash - which is now frozen. Imagine if you deposited a larger amount and then they just decide to block the account and its next to impossible to speak to someone. STAY AWAY. or your money could be frozen for no apparent reason and then they will ask you to answer 100 questions ( personal questions) about your business. Almost like they would then use the info for other purposes. Very sketchy. NORTHONE I would suggest you unblock the account or you'll spend your time doing damage control on posts like these."
90,1112,NorthOne,"Hailey and Leslie worked with me to secure my SBA funding.  In a few words, they were Awesome! Getting the bank letter they required and just reassured me NorthOne was with me. Thank you"
91,1112,NorthOne,I applied almost a month ago for an account. Still waiting with no updates. Not good for a bank that is going to manage your business funds
92,1112,NorthOne,Thief’s there reply has nothing to do with the check they stated they sent me for my balance and completely ignore you and never reply warned stay away read reviews they literally ignore I have proof no normal bank does this
93,1112,NorthOne,"They helped me through the web banking set up, and explaining the PayPal integration to me, I feel comfortable and secure knowing I can reach out to them through the live chat"
94,1112,NorthOne,"Easy to use, simple business banking. They have a flat fee that I pay instead of paying every time I pay suppliers."
95,1112,NorthOne,"You cant get more than one debit card. So when you have a partner, they cant have one which isn't fair. The customer service on chat was kind, but I still cant get what I need."
96,1112,NorthOne,"So far it’s okay, had a deposit issue that took days to remedy"
97,1112,NorthOne,"I would not recommend this Bank. I open up this account 09/16/2022, less than a month they charged me $10.00 fee on 10/04/2022, and then on 10/25/2022 they charged me another $10.00 fee. It is very hard to get ahold of them by phone, so you have to send a chat and most time the reason are not there. My account is closed now. I had 47.17 in that account because I deposit $40.00. now it was left at $37.17. They took my $10.00 on 10/25/2022. I want my money refunded. Now they are saying they will not give me a refund. Ya'll is pathetic stilling people money and putting in your pocket. The next step is Attorney General office or seek to sue them over $10.00.I got their response; you sure know how to clean up your reason, it to make it look like its customer fault. You still a rip off company."
98,1112,NorthOne,"Customer service and the north one blog really guided us through our financial problems when everything was scattered and not in order, it was bringing add stress to our business but North One’s resources helped us organize that and get our small business running as it should."
99,1112,NorthOne,"BUYER BEWARE!Opened the account. Deposited funds. The iPad app is total crap, works sort of maybe 1% of the time. After having the account for a few weeks, I can no longer login and then I get an email saying the acct is under review on 8/27. Now 2 weeks later, the same scripted reply that the account is under review. No one with a business can tolerate blocked access to their business banking account for days, let alone weeks. I think that NorthOne is a functioning scam and the positive reviews can't be real at all.UPDATE: Its now 3 months later and not one word from NorthOne on the status of their review or my account. So this just further shows the kind of company NorthOne is. They have kept the account locked for over 3 months. They have failed to communicate anything to me, but they have no problem with spamming me with 3rd party deals. Any inquiry to them generates the same pre-made email about how the security of their customers is their primary concern, which is quite rich because it looks to me like their customers are inconsequential to them and they are only protecting themselves. What from, you ask? No way to know, they won't share any info with their ""customer"" a.k.a. guinea pig for whatever scam they are running. This is not a made-up review; everything I have said is based on exactly what they have done. If you care about your money, get as far away from NorthOne as possible!"
100,1112,NorthOne,I was concerned about a deposit I made. But i was set at ease when it was explained the deposit would go thru by that night. It did and all is well. I’m new here so now I know I can rely on NorthOne to come through. Thanks!
101,1112,NorthOne,"NorthOne sucks, they really do.   They will make it so difficult to get proper help and will disregard your inquiries or any concerns. They will scam, do not trust them.It took time for my account to get set up and for my card to be received and I asked that the month not start until everything was ready and finalized but they went on charging me.  I didn't like the services and the lack support and perks they offered so I asked them to stop charging me per month and close my account at this point.They instead have continued to charge me per month and have drained the account even though I asked to to stop and close my account. There customer support is practically non existent and it feels as if they are trained to avoid you instead of help you. Imagine that!!!  I have been trying to reach customer service through their online chat portal and have no luck. It takes an hour to get connected then to send one message. I also looked for their phone support and have gotten nowhere. Nonexistent!They are so beyond ridiculous and deserve negative starts not even one star. I expect them to read this and fix this terrible experience or I will file a complain and not just a review.:This is a follow up edit on the review after NorthOne decided to respond.:I clearly asked on April 29th to stop getting charged fees. I did not receive any reply or help for that request. NorthOne are conveniently making themselves seem like they did the right thing and I have emails showing that to be a lie. Nice try but I stand by my review and am disgusted by NorthOne services and lies. Be ashamed of yourselves. This follow up response is a joke just like your terrible lack of customer support and your extravagant ways of wasting consumers precious time. Pay me back my hard earned money and scam yourselves in bankruptcy. Cheaters!"
102,1112,NorthOne,NorthOne's commitment to excellent customer support is commendable. Kudos to their team!
103,1112,NorthOne,"I recant my previous negative review. NorthOne were prompt in their response to my concerns in inquiry. They have been patient and professional. My account was set quickly after a few more inquiries. I still feel that should have a customer service number for inquiring potential customers. But, they were so quick to respond to my concerns that maybe they don't?  I've changed my reviews from 1 star to 5.---------------------------------------------------I applied with two different online business banks, and one of them was NorthOne. I never heard back from them until I attempted to login to check and see if I could find out the status. Once logged in, they directed me to the option to make a deposit. So maybe they did approve my account?? I went through the deposit process and got the message that they needed to verify more information and that should be completed in 24 hours. That took 3 additional days.They have a number (332) 205-9253, and when you call it, it tells you to either make an appointment with a customer rep or email customer service.  I emailed them, and long story short, because my email wasn't the same as the one I applied with, they couldn't answer any questions. I explained the email that applied with was an alias to my business email address, and that I'd be happy to provide any other information they needed, or can I please talk to someone.  I was told the number is for customers only and that I need to email them from the email address that I applied for the account with.  I was frustrated. First, I waited days to get a reply. Then, when I logged in, I found that they were ready for me to go to the next step which was make a deposit -- only to be told that I will need to wait an additional 24 hours for whatever else they needed to verify... The 24 hours turned into 72. So, I needed to call my hosting company to get my email name changed, which I did. convoluted Once I did that, I called and requested they terminate the application.  I-am-done."
104,1112,NorthOne,They are closing my account and not giving a reason why !!! It is a nonprofit organiztion account !!
105,1112,NorthOne,I received superb services at the counter. Very polite and adequate staff.
106,1112,NorthOne,"My account has been locked for 48 hours. I have not been able to talk to a person nor gotten any responses to the 8 emails I have sent to ""customer support"" I DO NOT recommend trusting NorthOne with your small business banking. I will never use an online only bank again. Its been a terrible experience and not worth $15/month in banks fees I was going to save. If you want access to your funds DO NOT trust NorthOne with them. They are liars, they replied once on Facebook that they emailed me. I guess its somewhat true I got 4 emails asking me to refer new customers to them. But 0 emails or communication regarding my locked account or their outright ignoring me for 48 hours. They will steal your money for no reason and ignore your attempts to contact them. On a side note its probably not great marketing to ask for referrals from someone you just stole money from and are now ignoring. But I did listen and have been giving feedback about how they stole my money are now ignoring me to anyone looking for a new bank. **** I deposited a business check from a fortune 500 company into my business checking account. 5 days after locking account they now want me to prove that check was actually paid to me. They want invoices, They asked how I got the check, like did I find it and randomly try cashing it? It's written to my business from a business there is no suspicious activity. Yet they come at me as though I stole the check and am cashing a check that isn't mine. More so than ever I believe NorthOne is a scam and out to hurt small business. DO NOT trust them with your money. I have no idea how long it will take me to prove my businesses money is mine and get it back. They will ignore you and make you jump through circus hoops to prove your money is yours.***** I still do not recommend NorthOne, my entire experience was terrible and their random locking of accounts for illegitimate and illegal reasons can destroy a small business. I received my check for the funds in my were in my account via 2 day UPS so they can get your money back to you in a timely manner. If you make enough noise. I commented on the CEO's linkedin page and posted public comments on facebook posts to finally get them responding to me. I promised to continue commenting publicly until I had my money returned."
107,1112,NorthOne,Great customer service and willingness to explain things and strive to keep your business.
108,1112,NorthOne,These people are crooks.  They opened a business account used it for months and then just decided to close it for no reason and keep my money. Run from them.
109,1112,NorthOne,"Non-stop run-around, and then they closed my account...banking for an educational nonprofit...without notice or explanation."
110,1112,NorthOne,"Fantastic product, happy that I opened an account in September"
111,1112,NorthOne,"Great banking service, easy to use, super helpful for my business"
112,1112,NorthOne,Good but not excellent!Waiting for a day for using my account.
113,1112,NorthOne,I have had to talk with an attorney and file complaint with bbb. They lied to me this company takes people money.
114,1112,NorthOne,Love NorthOne… this is the first review I’ve ever took the time to do so that says it all!!!
115,1112,NorthOne,"Based on my experience thus far, NorthOne is shady, at best, and a total fraud, at worst. I signed up thinking this would be a great banking app for my marketing needs. Deposited $50 and a few hours later, they suspended my account. Asked me to provide supporting documentation, which I did. Today, they closed my account with no reason as to why. They haven't responded to my replies, and it appears they're attempting to keep my $50 deposit as there was no mention of returning it to me in their correspondence. I also acquired referral signups but they appear not to be honoring those, either.Update after NorthOne's reply: I've received this same canned response AFTER I made several attempts to find out why they pulled a ""bait and switch"" routine. NorthOne has offered nothing new in this canned reply. In fact, they offered even less today. In their replies to me after I repeatedly asked them for an explanation, they refused to give me specifics as to why they closed my account after accepting my deposit and approving my account. They sent me a link to their referral terms/conditions, which they just modified last week to state ""you can refer to close, personal friends and family only."" Meanwhile, NorthOne advertises their signup/referral bonuses on sites such as Swagbucks, so there's no reason to believe that referring their promotion is something they did not want. What's clear is that NorthOne DID NOT want to honor their signup or referral bonus offerings, as they duped countless people - myself included - into applying for an account and depositing $50, and then suspended and closed the accounts.. Meanwhile, they now have copies of my driver's license, my SSN and other sensitive information.NorthOne claims to have sent me a check after I repeatedly inquired about it. I asked for proof of this and they have yet to provide me any proof, and I have still not received a check.Update 11/17/21 - It's been 8 days since NorthOne told me they were sending me a check to refund the $50 I deposited when signing up. I haven't received the check, and I asked about it this morning, to which ""Paulie"" replied, ""we advise that you please review the Account Agreement from here.""Update 5/31/22 - I finally received my check weeks after having to demand it from Northone.  I truly believe they would've kept my deposit had I not fought tooth-and-nail to get it back.  I also found that my original review back in November was removed, and they've got several suspicious 5-star reviews which I believe are from employees.  There's also one 3-star review and their reply encouraged the reviewer to change it to 5-star.  Shady and desperate.  Despite them seemingly trying to stack the deck with fake 5-star reviews, the 1-star genuine reviews are still coming in on this company's shady business practices.Based on my experience, I strongly warn against doing business with this awful company.Update 6/4/22 - The reply they gave to this is the same canned reply they gave on my original review, which they somehow got removed, hence this re-review.  I spent weeks going back and forth with them via email.  Out of all the people I spoke to, there was only one rep who was actually apologetic over the situation and professional.  All the others were as ridiculous as their reply to this review is."
116,1112,NorthOne,"So I’m an online marketer/freelancer that partakes and earns income from multiple opportunities online, referring to family/friends. I joined this app a few days ago to use and refer to others as well; they were running a $75 referral bonus for each successful person who signs up and deposits $50. So I joined and followed those instructions and received a few sign ups. Then the next day I was emailed that my account was suspended til I could provide documentation about my business and answer some of their questions. Inconvenience considering my account was accepted already, but I did as they requested and provided my information, answered their questions, and sent payment proof that I do earn income online from my business and sent some social media links so they could see exactly what it is I do (even though I did explain) Fast forward to Today, my account is closed & I can’t access the app/login and the person I’ve been speaking to hasn’t provided me any legitimate reason as to WHY my account was closed. Like she doesn’t care; I had to mention I was going to the BBB (which I am) if I don’t receive my money! Only then after mentioning that, did she say they would mail me a check! I’m awaiting her response as of now… not sure if the check is only for my deposit or for my sign on bonus/referral pay as well. Because she didn’t mention so. Support is BAD. (At least with this woman it is) Us marketers know each other, we talk. This is unfair treatment, sketchy, stealing, & bad business. We did the work; least they could do is honor their referral program and pay us. So that’s why I give NorthOne Bank a 1 star.UPDATE 11/12/2021, after NorthOne’s reply: I received the exact same response from y’all that other’s have received; y’all have provided no additional info, simply copying & pasting scripts to everyone to make yourself seem professional, however still not answering our concerns as to why y’all are shutting down accounts left & right and not paying people what’s due to them; this is not good business! (PS, that link… yall modified last week AFTER I & others joined… stating, “you can refer to close, personal family and friends only” which is what I do!) So either way, I followed your rules, yet y’all don’t wanna honor your own referral program! That’s sad. Y’all ‘tricked’ a bunch of people, including myself, into joining & depositing $50 and then turn around and suspend & eventually shut down our accounts, AFTER we submit to y’all personal/sensitive info like our driver’s license and ssn! If that’s not suspicious I don’t know what is. Also! Y’all claim to have sent me a check (which I have not received & I’m still waiting on) And y’all haven’t even responded back to my email where I request a photo copy of the check (cause I wasn’t told how much the check would be for) and tracking. ? So I can send y’all details that y’all claim you need to help reinstate my account (tho y’all closed it)!! but y’all can’t send me proof of sending my check? What BS. Seems one sided, don’t it? (For anyone reading this) I do NOT recommend trying NorthOne. Most people, including myself, are displeased!- I did file a claim with the BBB."
117,1112,NorthOne,"Chat was super quick and helpful, highly recommend!"
118,1112,NorthOne,Amazed by the NorthOne app. Amazing features. Don’t have to worry about papers and docs. Really quick to sign up. Good stuff
119,1112,NorthOne,"If I had a chance to give them 0 stars I would! STAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK AT ALL COSTS!!! I worked very hard for monthsssssss with Medicare to start receiving payments and the second my first payment came in they automatically suspended my account and I gave them all documentation they asked for to remove the suspension off and after sending everything they respond to me saying sorry we are closing your account I reply back to them writing a nice paragraph they stopped responding to my emails, but when I was emailing them prior they were quickly responding after my paragraph they completely stopped responding to me I work with patients I work with the government Medicare and HMO insurances I work with terminally ill patients and I work with vendors, Nurses, DME & Supply that are expecting payment for their services they’ve provided for my patients and now I have to reach back to Medicare and start the process again thank you northone for all my cost loss and they will definitely hear from my attorney"
120,1112,NorthOne,Company closed account 9 months ago and still hasn’t sent my funds.
121,1112,NorthOne,"Received a crappy response on a weekend from Northone although they supposedly don’t work weekends and I’m baffled due to the fact that they stated my funds from my PPP loans are being returned back to SBA when I never had a PPP loan smh, it was clearly a EIDL, they’re two separate loans so maybe that’s where the problem began, I would like to receive clarification on how long it takes to remit my EIDL funds back to SBA instead of to myself seeing as to how I’m responsible for my entire loan regardless of where the funds are remitted back to? Also my account was said to be closed for a 4th time now and remaining funds being remitted back to SBA but as of 1/16/2021 the account balance is still the same, please advise!"
122,1112,NorthOne,"NorthOne has the friendliest, quickest, & most helpful customer service I’ve ever interacted with."
123,1112,NorthOne,I love this bank. It's quick and you don't have a long wait time to speak with someone.
124,1112,NorthOne,"These people are just simply pathetic I was using my account very peacefully, and suddenly when I deposited a check, they suspended my account and told me if I provided all detail, they would reinstate I provided everything they asked for, and  still, they closed my account they don't answer my email, and when I try to contact support no one answer I have more then $20K in my account,t and they are not giving my money back they don't answer I want them to send me my money through wire transfer or Ach transfer I need my money back right now that is a very pathetic approach by them I want my money back otherwise I am opening a case through a lawyer I told them i have an issue of receiving a check on my mail address and they don't answer"
125,1112,NorthOne,Very safe services and account
126,1112,NorthOne,NorthOne has been wonderful.
127,1112,NorthOne,
128,1112,NorthOne,Got my account in 10 minutes
129,1112,NorthOne,
130,1112,NorthOne,"Very punctual with responding, and helping"
131,1112,NorthOne,Hi I just wanted to know if I can sign up with you guys
132,1112,NorthOne,"I signed up for NorthOne about a month ago.  All was going well until I was notified one day that my referral link had been removed and more information was requested about my business.  Confused about this I replied back to NorthOne that I had already provided the requested information during sign up and was only told, ""All banks occasionally review customer accounts..."".  I still found this odd, but complied with their request and provided the requested information the next day.  After I provided the information, I was told ""Your referral link has been removed and will not be reactivated"" in spite of me providing everything they asked for.  When I inquired why I was being treated with such disdain and accusatory nature, the support only replied that they could not tell me why my link was revoked, and simply referred me to their terms of service.  I read over the terms and nothing in them applied to me in any way.  This occurred after I referred two people who are also small business owners to the bank.  It appears they removed my link so that they would not have to pay the referral bonuses.  Having not broke ANY of their rules or terms this is the only logical explanation. I've never in my life seen such scamming tactics utilized by a legitimate bank.  It's shameful.edit: After reading some of the other reviews, I feel slightly better to know that I wasn't singled out and that  NorthOne is just an awful scam ridden bank.  I find it amusing they have this canned response:""All financial service companies are required to evaluate their products, services and customers periodically."" (I also received this response when engaging with customer service via email).My Lili small business banking account has never treated me this way so they can keep this awful canned response to themselves."

So far my experience has been alright, making my first payment was a bit confusing and the due dates for payment that I was told over the phone, at the dealership and on my payment slips that were mailed to me were not consistent so I wasn’t sure when/if late fees would truly occur. Other than that I’ve had a good experience thus far."

I called ahead to make sure that there was one available and was told that there were three, so we went right in. We went to let a teller know that we needed to speak to a loan officer, and then sat in the waiting area for 25 minutes while employees walked through the waiting area--no one making eye contact or saying anything. After the 25 minutes, a manager came out and asked if we had been helped, and if we had told a teller that we were there. After that a loan officer (Jorge) helped us draw up papers. Our 2nd visit was to finalize our transaction. I had emailed Jorge the day before to let him know what time we were able to come in. We peeked in to see if Jorge was busy, and he helped us immediately. I would give this visit 5 stars! Jorge was very friendly,  and everything went very well!I have confidence that in the future, employees will be aware of customers in the waiting room."

346,1115,Asic Miners Rig,"This company is a SCAM.  I paid for a miner.  They sent a confiramation and then a fake shipping company TransGlobalExpress-US sent me a notice that I needed to pay $1,300 additional, from which $1,000 is refundable.  No bill to pay, just an overseas linked phone number that demanded that I pay this money.When asked for a refund, they said NO.  Pure SCAM."
347,1115,Asic Miners Rig,"Pretty sure Trustpilot is complicit in this scam. I too fell for it after weeks of research, etc. Saw the high ratings for TP and now out $4700. I'm working with my bank, the FTC, and lawyer to hit these guys were it hurts. If you've been scammed by these guys, and anyone that's dealt with them has, contact your bank, law enforcement the FTC. BTW you have to give at least one star to give a review."
348,1115,Asic Miners Rig,"These are planted reviews. Their website is also a dead giveaway. No links to any of their social media, only wanting wire or crypto. Scam!! They lied and said their PayPal was down too even though it says they accept it on their website. Do not USEUpdate after they responded - this is not malicious. I don’t want people Scammed. FYI go look at their website under “We Accept” . They have a picture of “cash on delivery” which includes Visa,Paypal, etc. But they only want you to pay with payment methods that offer you no protection. Look at the links. Their social media links are fake. They link to nothing. Website was created 11-15-2021. Use caution."
349,1115,Asic Miners Rig,"Scam is simple.  You buy asic miner in crypto from Dan or Max. You receive a paid invoice from Asic Miners Rig.  Another email is sent to you with a 'spoof' carrier website and tracking number.  Then just days before 'spoof' carrier website states asic miner is to be delivered to you.  You receive a generic email from the 'transport carrier' that US Customs is holding up your Asic miner and you need to pay thousands of dollars to have it released. Payment can only be made in crypto or bank wire. If you don't pay then the item will be return and according to asciminersrigs website you will read the following disclaimer... 'Asic Miners Rig Blockchain & Cryptocurrency B.V. shall not be liable for any cost of damage or expense as a result of error from calculating taxes and duties pertaining to your order.Please be noted that upon delivery of the products to the carrier, it shall be deemed completion of our delivery, and the title and the risk of damage and loss of the product(s) shall be transferred to you. This includes possible shipping fees as we do not accept any refund request in case of failure of customs clearance.'Please don't respond asic miners rig (Dan, Max or whatever your names really are) and say ""Where is the proof - where is your invoice - where is your order number. This person lies about us, and did not complete his obligation."" I will be more than happy to add to your 'reply' more documentation in support of my claims.Please note there are other websites like this one.  These websites even contain the same color scheme and company logo, but the name is different."
350,1115,Asic Miners Rig,"THESE PEOPLE ARE SCAMMERS!  BEWARE!!! DO NOT 🚫 SEND THEM ANY MONEY OR CRYPTO.  THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY OF THESE MINERS.  THEY ONLY WANT YOU TO PLACE AN ORDER AND PAY.ONCE YOU DO, YOU RECEIVE A ""CONFIRMATION"" EMAIL AMD THEN A CPL DAYS LATER AN SEMI OFFICIAL LOOKING EMAIL FROM ""TRANS GLOBAL EXPRESS"".  IT WILL HAVE YOUR ORDER INFO AND A REAL LOOKING TRACKING NUMBER.  ALL OF THAT IS A SETUP FOR THIS PART WHICH IS WHERE THE SCAM KICKS IN:. TWO DAYS BEFORE THE MINER IS DUE TO ARRIVE AN EMAIL COMES.  STATING BLAH BLAH BLAH ABOUT US CUSTOMS AND about a ""Discrete Parcel Insurance Tax"" that's ""99% refundable"".   TALKING ABOUT SEND THEM ANOTHER 2300 DOLLARS (IN BITCOIN OF COURSE) TO HAVE THE PACKAGE RELEASED FROM COLUMBUS, OHIO.  AT THAT POINT $2000 OF MY $2300 WOULD BE REFUNDED AUTOMATICALLY.  WAIT WHAT HAPPENED TO 99%.  1% OF $2300 IS $23.  SO WHY THEY WANNA KEEP $300??? SINCE WHEN DID ES CUSTOMS WORK PIKE THIS ANYWAY????? THE THEY QUOTE SOME FAKE US CODE AND SECTION TO MAKE IT ALL SOUND OFFICIAL.  IT ALL BULLS**T.  AND TRUST PILOT IF YOU TAKE THIS REVIEW DOWN, I'MMA GET IN YOUR ASS TOO!  CUZ THEN YOU'RE COMPLICIT IN THIS S**T!!!!  CANCEL THIS VENDOR!!! NEVER ORDER FROM THIS WEBSITE.  EVER!LEARN FROM MY $4700+ LOSS.  NEVER EVER EVER EVER BUY FROM ASICMINERSRIG!!!!  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED......"
351,1115,Asic Miners Rig,"Yes these people are the bloody scammers. Also got scammed by this company and TP is also promoting them. I saw their review in TP and ordered $4700.Then I had to ask them to give me a invoice. Few days later they gonna send you a fake tracking number from ""https://transglobalexpress-us(dot)com"" with a express delivery around after 7 days. which is also a scamming company.After few days they gonna ask for $2300 just to do customs clearance and handling. Where they gonna say they will refund you $2000 and gonna keep $300 for fees. Like below:""1 .  Following Section 7, Article 4 (USA-07/4  039746/95) of 13th July 1999 of the USA Tax Administration  and the International Regulatory Board for Cargo transportation ( IRBCT), Customized Packages being transported Within Canada and the United States and across any country in general would have to be registered into the USA Tax scheme.2 . According to Section 8, Article 10 ( USA-07/17  031246/95) of 13th July 1998, the Tax scheme is 100% refundable . So you are expected to make the payment of  2300USD that would be used to purchase and register your Package against lost and damages .3 . Out of the  2300USD  that you will pay for the Refundable Tax Scheme on your Package, a total of 2000USD would be refunded to you.""If you pay them $2300 amount. Now they are asking for $1500 more covid-19 related handlings. They gonna send you a letter with all caps and at the end they gonna ask for more money.""https://transglobalexpress-us(dot)com"" and ""asicminersrig.com"" they are both fraud. I already filed a complain to the FBI IC3 division about their cyber scam. I am contacting with my bank and FTC to get these scammers. And I will work with a community to hunt these people down so they cant scam any more people. So If you are reading these review please stay away from these scammers and also Trust Pilot reviews. I have lost all the trust on them."
352,118,Kryptominerstech,Express delivery as stipulated on the website is as accurate as it is written. My KD5 was  delivered in perfect condition with the promised Graphic cards. If I hadn’t ordered a few others from another provider I definitely would’ve gotten more from these guys. Now I can continue my minning journey.
467,114,Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union,"Heritage has been amazing,  I live an hour from any office and still will not use anyone but Heritage Valley,  I know if I need anything, I can call and get nothing less than professional yet family like assistance,  Heritage has helped me with everything from my home mortgage to the purchase of my automobile. Thanks"
468,114,Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union,"I have been a customer of HVFCU for over 17 years.  When I started to run behind in my credit card payments, instead of contacting me to see if they could negotiate a reason or settlement with me, they opted to sue me.  Most companies that care about their customers try to create an open communication to assist when a client  falls behind.  That is if they really care about their customers."
469,114,Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union,"I have used HVFCU for decades!  Very helpful and responsive online help.  Courteous and friendly tellers.  We have had numerous loans through them, car and personal.  We also just refinance to a 15 year mortgage.  The processes were always very smooth.  Would definitely recommend!"
470,114,Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union,"Heritage Valley is an amazing company filled with so many helpful people. They helped me consolidate my debt, which helped my credit score increase over time."
471,114,Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union,"I have been a member of Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union for 35+ years.  My 3 sons were members since they were children when they had the dinosaur accounts.  We love doing business with the credit union.  Patricia, Marcus, Michael and Stephen"
472,114,Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union,Had a great experience with a Home Equity Loan.  It was a super easy and fast process and would recommend them to anyone looking for this type of loan.
473,114,Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union,I have been with HVFCU for years!  The team is friendly and helpful no matter what your concerns or needs are - loans or account questions are quickly resolved.
474,114,Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union,I have been a member for years with HVFCU and the staff are always smiling & happy to greet you and help you in a way.  If I have a problem on line they are quick to fix the problem.  I enjoy using their friendly; easy app as well!

476,114,Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union,Good for the most part.  Their app / website can be confusing and weird at times.
477,114,Heritage Valley Federal Credit Union,"We are new to HVFCU, pleased with their banking.I also like the free coin counter!"
478,110,Evergreen Credit Union,A descriptive title must have at least 4 letters
479,110,Evergreen Credit Union,Best banking experience ever. From friendly courteous staff to online and mobile app to loans to communication your services are stellar!
480,110,Evergreen Credit Union,We applied for a personal loan in May 2023.  We were told that we had the loan on a Monday and then on Tuesday we were told by Karen Durling that we didn’t get the loan.   We have been members for a long time and now we don’t even recommend Evergreen to anyone.
481,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"The loan process was smooth and simple. Happy Alexander was excellent during the whole process. She kept me informed and updated during the entire loan process. While assisting me, she had a pleasant and friendly attitude."
482,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"We have had nothing but top notch service with the staff at the South Portland location. From financing vehicles, to getting a HELOC,  getting a new boat, and assisting us with transferring money to our son in the military... the SP ECU staff are always friendly and get our needs taken care of efficiently! Five Stars all the way!!!"
483,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I worked with Isaiah on a ATV loan. The entire process was very effortless, simple and fast. It took about 3 days from my first reaching out to the day I picked up my new purchase. Would definitely recommend working with them!"
484,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Happy was very helpful and stayed in contact with me for every step of the process of my RV purchase. Her response time was fast to any of my first-timer questions! She made the funding process race rapid! Because of work, I had to do everything via email and online. It was not daunting at all! Happy made it simple. Ever so thankful!"
485,110,Evergreen Credit Union,From my initial inquiry to securing a membership and vehicle loan (at a very competitive rate!) the process was smooth and easy. But the folks I dealt with (Casey and Chelsey) were outstanding. Quick and helpful replies and very great to work with. For the vehicle loan Chelsey made the preapproval process right through picking up the check about as easy as it can get. She even worked with the dealership on my behalf to keep them straight.
486,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I worked with Kacie and was referred over by Riverside Auto.  What a seamless process!! I could not be happier with the service and the smooth transaction. Highly recommend!!!
487,110,Evergreen Credit Union,Joelle was fantastic. She made everything so easy. When I visited the branch to pick up the check to bring to the dealership everyone was very pleasant and helpful.
488,110,Evergreen Credit Union,
489,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"We are long-time Evergreen CU customers, from our checking accounts, auto loans, and mortgages. We've completed several home purchases and refinances over the years, and find the loan servicing easy and reliable.  The Evergreen app allows us to transfer funds between accounts quickly, pay our mortgage, and check the status of deposits easily. We only wish there was another branch in the Scarborough/Saco area for convenience when we have in-person banking needs. Also wish their partnership with the Maine Mariners provided customers with perks, as we are Mariners fans. Thanks!"
490,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I had not applied for an auto loan in over 25 years and was nervous about qualifying. Abbie Taylor made the process easy and simple. I got a great rate and I also have a credit card with an awesome rate! Me! Thanks SO much for everything!
491,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I was very impressed with the car loan process with Evergreen.  From start to finish the process was very professional and they worked to make it fit my schedule!
492,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Anne could not have been more helpful. I have a mystery charge on my Apple account, because of course I do. Anne offered a few different options and helped me sort it out. I have been living in Massachusetts for seven years but I have stayed with Evergreen because of people like Anne. Unlike big banks, Evergreen is staffed by actual humans who live actual real-world lives. Evergreen staff are always professional and don’t always tell me what I want to hear. But at least they’re nice about it."
493,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Kacie Cannell was so incredibly helpful! I appreciated the effort to make sure I understood and was comfortable with every aspect of the loan application process. She patiently took my calls and answered my emails in a timely manner and was courteous and knowledgeable. Kudos to her! And, well done Evergreen for employing a class act."
494,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I applied for a small personal loan with Chelsey Cargen at the South Portland branch. Chelsey made the approval process very easy and communicated important updates and details in a timely manner. I already have a checking, savings and sun select credit card with EGCU and am grateful to be building my credit and savings with a great institution. Thank you!"
495,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I ordered a Toyota RAV4 Prime in late winter ""22 and applied for a car loan from Cassandra Hanson at the Riverside, Westbrook office. She OK'ed my application with a 2% interest, but the loan could not be finalized until delivery of the car, which took place around May 22. In the mean time interest rates had gone up, but she convinced the upper management to let her keep the interest at 2%. I appreciate the keeping of promises.Sincerely, Stig Ammentorp"
496,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Today I had one of the best customer service experiences ever at EGCU. It was found my debit card had been compromised and needed to be replaced. I went to the credit union on Broadway in South Portland and as I stood there waiting for a new card I had a great conversation with both the teller working on my issue and another who was waiting for customers. Both were so professional, courteous, and genuinely kind. Not because that's their job but because they sincerely cared and it was apparent. Later at home I had to make a call back to the CU due to an issue updating a site with recurring billing using the new card. I experienced exactly the same level of attention and caring. There came a point where I was so overwhelmed and moved by this I asked who to reach out to there so I could be sure they received my gratitude. I have been a loyal EGCU customer for over 20 years. If anyone asked me to recommend a place to do their banking EGCU is unmatched. When I dealt with staff today I wasn't being waited on at a business. I felt like I was part of a family. Kudos to Evergreen Credit Union for providing stellar customer service and showing just how much they care about their patrons!"
497,110,Evergreen Credit Union,Best credit union ever.easy to work with for new customers like myself they are super helpful and welcoming. I get approved in short time for my son’s first time car loan. to all refugee and asylum like I me I recommend you evergreen credit union .you will be happy .
498,110,Evergreen Credit Union,Cassie was awesome.  The original solution to my problem was to come into the banking location.  Cassie noted that this would be an issue as I currently live in Arizona.  She came to a solution that solved my problem while still allowing Evergreen to maintain their protocols.  Such great customer service!
499,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Sarah was available, kind, prompt, and thoughtful. She explained everything really well and guided us through our first time taking out a mortgage. She moved quickly, the rates she quoted were better than other lenders (sometimes by a whole point!) and she was fun to work with. We couldn't recommend her or Evergreen more highly!"
500,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Found out the hard way that business debit cards are set by default to allow you to go negative for basic in-store purchases vs normal debit cards that would deny the purchase. Lead to two $32 ""convenience"" fees for going -$11. Doesn't feel very convenient but at least they reversed one INSF fee for me. They also removed the option that allows the card to go negative for those basic in-store purchases."
501,110,Evergreen Credit Union,Great Choice for a Motorcycle Loan. Shiny new bike caught my eye at the dealership and Evergreen FCU was able to quickly sort out loan details and get me riding. They beat other lenders rates by 10% or more with my excellent credit. Setting up an account was easy and allowed me to take advantage of the autopay discount.
502,110,Evergreen Credit Union,We have been members of Evergreen credit Union for over 30 years and in that time we have always had amazing service.  Recently we worked with Chelsey Cargen on a LOC and not only did she get it done fast but was great with communication and expectations of the loan.  She made us feel like we were her priority and always with a smile.   She clearly loves her job and we are grateful we had her to guide us.  SUPER CUSTOMER SERVICE IN ALL AREAS.
503,110,Evergreen Credit Union,The personal concern I received from Sarah and Heidi too made all the difference. I had some debt and a family need that needed help. Heidi made a suggestion to me and Sarah followed through. Thank you Evergreen Credit Union ladies.
504,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Isaiah Wright is my loan officer. Very helpful, professional and well informed.Fantastic experience and done very efficiently. Can't say enough good things about him. Appreciate his thoroughness and great suggestions. Ona report card the grade would be A++. Thank you. Abigail Parker"
505,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Outstanding customer service.  We were guided expertly through the loan process in this confusing time of COVID.  Our loan officer, Alice Goodwin,   made the whole process understandable and so easy.  Thank you so much.  We look forward to many more years with Evergreen Credit Union."
506,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I was having difficulty connecting my new business account to Quick Books. Paul LeBlond took the time to do some detective work to solve it! It was so nice to work with someone as committed to customer service as Paul. I would definitely recommend.
507,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"We recently secured a business loan and was amazed at how easy the staff in the commercial loan department made the process. Every email and phone call was quickly responded to. The staff is knowledgeable and very willing to spend whatever time was necessary. As a result of our experience, we will look to Evergreen first for all of our future business banking needs."
508,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I worked with Stephanie Wilkinson and she made the loan process a breeze! After we spoke on the phone she provided everything I needed via email and she was able to send me the signature loan documents securely via email.  I was able to complete the loan process without leaving my house. It was one of the best experiences I've ever had securing a loan. I would absolutely recommend Evergreen Credit Union!
509,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I meet Chelsea in December of 22 by chance from a friend that had introduced us. I came to Evergreen for help with my credit card payments. She was very gracious to help me all the way through so that I could get my cards bundled into one payment. She is very pleasant to work with.  And I am so very grateful for her kind words to help ease me the stress that I was feeling. I will continue to work with her on any upcoming opportunities. Next thing on the list is development a budget plan.
510,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Isaiah was extremely helpful in answering any questions regarding the issue I encountered with my account.  He was knowledgeable, friendly, and confident he could help find a solution.  He should be used as an example for how to interact with customerts and help them through their issues."
511,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Isaiah and team saved a very large loan from going somewhere else!  He stepped up to the plate, got his hands dirty to do some digging, and made it happen!  He even got the customer to sign docs while he was on his way out of the country!!!  The service and commitment to my customers and my team is amazing!  You're lucky to have him on your team!"
512,110,Evergreen Credit Union,The customer representative was very helpful with our questions and the process of opening up our accounts and credit cards. The facility was cheerful and staff also friendly. We felt confident with our decision making the move to this credit union.

Of course you have to meet the banking criteria but once you develop a relationship with the staff at evergreen credit Union they will bend over backwards to work with you.

She then came back to the phone and introduced Paul. Bailey displayed excellent customer service skills!!! Thank you Bailey and Paul!!"
522,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"The loan process with Evergreen representative Taylor was seamless, she couldn't have made it easier if she tried.

526,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"As a longtime member of ECU, I have had an outstanding experience with this institution.Recently, in the midst of a nation wide automobile shortage, I found myself in need of a vehicle….quickly.  Murphy’s Law.   While shopping, I found that inventory was changing hands within hours.Amanda Southworth assisted me in this process, after reassuring me that we would get the job done.  She proved incredibly nimble in this fluid market, offered great advice and remained very responsive.  I was able to shop for a vehicle with confidence. An invaluable thing when dealing with the occasional less than reputable sales types in a sellers market.   We did in fact get the job done the very next day.After two mortgages, and now two auto loans, I could not recommend ECU enough.  My longtime relationship with Cathy any most recently Amanda, leaves me feeling they are both banking rockstars."
527,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I was experiencing some issues with your on online portal and so I went into the Windham office and Jennel Berry was amazing she figured out what the problem was and fixed it and had me out the door in no time.

530,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Evergreen made the whole process of getting my boat loan so easy and fast. Applying online was simple, and after a few hours and one phone conversation, everything was approved and ready to go. They also had a great rate & term that other local lenders could not beat."
531,110,Evergreen Credit Union,As usual customer service was excellent. I could not open an additional account online so used the message feature to communicate with ECU. Paige responded and had Cassie call and she was able to set the account up over the phone. I was expecting to go to the branch so that made my day. Alway friendly and professional customer service at ECU.

I'm so sorry that I can not remember the woman that assisted me on my phone call from your customer service department but she was AMAZING!  Hands down the best customer service I have had in a while.  She took the time to give me the infomation I requested but then went ABOVE AND BEYOND and explained another feature that you had that I was not yet using that she thought might simplify things for me.  IT WILL!!!  She also stayed on the line and walked me through it.  My only issue is I can't remember her name and I would like to give her full credit!!!
537,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"The loan process was fast, easy and professional. The person that handled the transaction was terrific and offered to help refinance any other loans if we were so inclined. ( we did a few weeks later)On a scale of 1 to 5 a definite 12!"

542,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"My wife and I both reached out to our respective bank / credit unions for quotes on this camper loan.  Not only were the rates higher with our institutions, the application process was more burdensome, and we were presented with less options for the loan.  We were very impressed with the responsiveness of Evergreen, the rate and the terms.  We will do additional business with Evergreen in the future based on this experience."
543,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I've been with Evergreen since 2010 and they've always been helpful and attentive. Their mobile banking is easy to navigate and their Fraud Protection department is quick and thorough when my card had been compromised. They're always professional and happy to answer any questions regarding my accounts. I would recommend Evergreen CU to anyone.
544,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I am always happy with the service I get at Evergreen.  I have never been disappointed with any Member Services representatives.  Anne Libby completed the transaction I asked for help with today and then adjusted the two accounts so I can complete the same type of transaction myself, the next time it is necessary.  Anne, particularly, has always been helpful and a cheery face when I first joined Evergreen and she was the first person I saw upon entering my branch!"
545,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I needed help with my account today and Sean/Shawn (sp?) was extremely helpful. He listened to my problem and let me know he was going to look for further assistance.

548,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I just want to say that this was the fastest service in my time of need. My transmission went in my truck and was very expensive, I didn't know how i was going to pay for it. so, I emailed Danielle Dulac whom I have dealt with before and BOOM loan got approved, check written to the dealership with in 72 hour! NOW THATS WHAT I CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!fast, friendly and spot on!!"
549,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"In general the process was ok, but there was always an excuse as to why the girl that was helping wouldn't call me back. I also thought I opened a checking account on line, i even requested a debit card.. so when I went to the bank for the first time afterwards I asked why I hadn't received my card and I was told my account was just a savings and for the loan I have. I asked her to please change it to a checking account she told me she couldn't do it but she would have someone contact me within a couple of days. It's been almost 2 weeks and I'm not longer interested in changing banks."
550,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I was thrilled with the customer service I received both online and in person when I decided to get a loan through Evergreen. The staff was incredibly accommodating, friendly, and professional, and everything went very smoothly. I will definitely be doing more business with them in the future!"

552,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I moved to the area 18months ago. Then Covid hit. I was using my old credit union and struggling with the long distance. I chose Evergreen for no particular reason except they were not a National Bank and were local. I have not regretted it at all.The staff are all friendly and helpful. After opening the account I started slowly using them. I wanted a new camper and asked about a loan. They made the process so easy. I secured a loan with them. Just last week I decided to switch my direct deposit and move all my banking needs to them. I have been with my old bank for over 20yrs and am usually loyal. Looking forward to using Evergreen for my next loan.
553,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"The experience was incredible. I called to inquire about a loan and had a few preconceived ideas of what I was thinking for a rate and a timeline. I had a short conversation about my needs and expectations and was reassured that we were in line with each other. After a 5 minute phone, I was sure that I could get a rate that I wanted for a time duration I expected and had an appointment on a Saturday morning as soon as the doors opened. After 10 minutes I had a check in had to go purchase my vehicle and confident that the loan was everything I expected. The rate was better than the dealerships I had been dealing with and was in my new vehicle by noon.If my other experiences buying a vehicle were ever this great I would want to buy a new vehicle every year."
554,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I have been with Evergreen since the early 80s when it was SD Warren Credit Union. Accounts, loans, member services - it all excels. I will never bank anywhere else and recommend it highly!!"

560,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Chelsey was wonderful! She helped me refinance my auto loan. I had no idea where to start & she told me exactly what docs I needed to get & set up all the paperwork. Plus, she's really nice! 10/10"
561,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I have been with Evergreen Credit Union for 15 years? When we applied for a PPP loan a few years ago in 2000, we spoke with Julie Littell, and every word was focused and efficient. I thought, boy would I love to hire her away. I didn't try of course, but that was the level that I saw her at.As far as the PPP forgiveness application, I figured it would be the gargantuan probe of my finances. That's fine, but I hate document gathering. So I procrastinated until after sending 2-3 emails. Kevin Sullivan  finally called me and walked me through the process. Basically he said click a couple buttons. They had already done all the work for me. All the form and what was required was essentially done. All I had to do was review and approve it. Mr. Sullivan was just as efficient as Ms. Littell, and I am starting to realize that it is their culture.I am so glad that I have been with Evergreen Credit Union. Thank you Ms. Littell and Mr. Sullivan, for making the experience as smooth as was physically possible. I am so impressed."

574,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Overall a decent experience. My biggest complaint is the slowness of the company in general. I sat up to Camping World for hours thinking it was them that was the issue but it turns out it was this credit union. Nothing was said until almost three hours later that the loan initiator did not have all the information. Three hours I will never get back. But after that he really stepped up to make sure things flew through. On the billing side of things...also super slow. Just got my info to pay my bill 4 days prior to the due date, Makes me nervous...I always pay my bills well before they are due. But the web site is pretty awesome and easy to set up. Overall not bad just slow on things I think should be addressed as being quicker.Thanks!"

678,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"The loan process was quick and easy. Everyone involved was professional, courteous and wonderful to deal with. I will definitely use them again in the future."
679,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I appreciate you. Thank you for making the extra effort to answer my questions and finding the information I needed. I am genuinely grateful for the time you took and the kindness you shared. I’ve been a customer since I was a kid and your service has been one of the biggest reasons my entire family has stayed customers. (As a recommendation, I would love to see checks deposited independently so I can have a record of individual deposits. This would help me self-serve and help myself manage my accounts)."
680,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I've been with Evergreen for 50 years and have had best service with you.
681,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I needed some documents for a mortgage that I thought would be difficult to obtain, since I am not online with Evergreen.  My requests were processed with ease and efficiency and took a great weight off my shoulders!  Thank you, Evergreen and Ilea!"
682,110,Evergreen Credit Union,
683,110,Evergreen Credit Union,We got charged twice for a purchase so I left a message on my account page to question the extra charge. The first person who responded to my message pretty much said there wasn't anything to be done because it was a debit purchase and I should take it up with the vender to get a refund. This didn't sound right to me so I called the bank and talked with Anne Libby. She filed a dispute on our behalf and got Card Services to initiate an investigation. She was very polite and helpful and handled the issue in a professional manner!

686,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"We have been working with Evergreen for several months on informational seminars for our staff, covering various financial wellness and literacy topics. I am very pleased with the quality of the information provided in these meetings; our contacts at Evergreen are professional and very easy to work with. The staff has had great feedback about the quality of information and the way it is presented. In addition, when it was necessary to pivot from in-person meetings to an online platform, the change was made seamlessly. I am so glad we did not have to pause this relationship until in-person meetings are an option again! I could not be any more pleased about our relationship with Evergreen and look forward to continuing it well into the future."
687,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Very easy transaction, quick, clear, complete"

700,110,Evergreen Credit Union,Shelby Oakes is a fantastic member services coordinator. She did everything in her power to help resolve my situation. And in the end it had a very good outcome in my favor.
701,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"My husband and I have been EGCU members for years. We have always appreciated their ability to make decisions in-house, their help with our accounts through hard times and their flexibility during good times to help us get the best products for our needs. I also like that you can still call them and get a person right here in Maine! Who lives in Maine! Providing that sort of personal banking is becoming hard to find. You can make connections with their customer service support folks or your local branch workers. Been burned by banks in the past. It is only a credit union for us!"
702,110,Evergreen Credit Union,I really don’t see that you have to make any changes. The tellers are great and any time I need help if they can’t help me they will make sure someone else can help.
703,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I have found this credit union to be very professional, friendly, and extremely efficient."
704,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I have been a credit union member way back when my father was a firefighter back in the 1970s. When I moved to Windham back in 2011, I found Evergreen FCU, Became a member. I was blessed to meet some of the best Lady's ever. We went from and old building, a trailer, to the best Credit Union building ever. If your looking for the best bank, Try Evergreen FCU. you will not be disappointed.  Stephen Shaw"
705,110,Evergreen Credit Union,Doing business with evergreen is always a pleasure. Very easy to deal with and very professional. You are the best
706,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"I joined ECU when I lived in Maine. Everyone was so helpful, that I decided to keep my account open when I moved to PA. Here I am almost 10 years later living in a different state and I will never switch to a local bank. Lindsay Nunley helped me finance a fun new toy very quickly.  She is one of the most helpful people that I have worked with.  Reminded me why I bank with you guys. Thanks Lindsay!"

708,1110,Meriwest Credit Union,"As a client of Meriwest Credit Union, I am thoroughly impressed with their overall services. The staff is consistently engaging, professional, and ready to help, which makes for a very positive communication experience.Their credit terms are transparent and easy to understand. This was particularly beneficial when I was looking to finance my automobile purchase. The terms were advantageous, offering great value and fitting well with my financial planning.In summary, Meriwest Credit Union offers not only top-notch service, but also advantageous credit conditions. My experience financing my car through them was seamless and stress-free. I wholeheartedly recommend Meriwest for anyone in need of financial services."
709,1110,Meriwest Credit Union,"I was an almost 30 year client of Meriwest until they upgraded their login system with minimal notification and locked my out of my account.  After multiple attempts, I final sent a registered letter to close my account back in March, and have yet to get my money back (now May).  They continue to send me e-notices even though I have told them multiple times I can't login (probably telling me about all the fees that they are charging me rather than giving my money back as requested).  I suspect I am going to have to get a lawyer involved to get my money back from them.Bottom line:  I would bury my money in glass jars in the backyard before I would use Meriwest again.  They certainly put profits ahead of customer satisfaction."
710,1110,Meriwest Credit Union,"If I could give a -10 I would. We have had IBM then Meriwest for over 50 years. The customer service is terrible. After waiting for 45 minutes last week and never getting the escalation callback, I had to wait another 45 minutes today. I cannot log into my on-line account. Their solution - come into a branch. Problem is the closest branch is an eight hour drive. RUN far away from them!"

715,1116,Coin Cloud,"WARNING:  These guys are crooks, beware!! I purchased Litecoin for $926. Seconds later I received Litecoin for $627.Fees on receipt were $95 which is legit, but where are the other $200? I reach out to customer support and wish I hadn't. She rudely repeated the fees are between 10-22 percent and even though the number do not add up, she refused to provide any information or help. Instead I was told I can either do nothing or close my account.Zero stars are too many."
716,1116,Coin Cloud,"Like most of you on here... What did Coincloud do with our money. June,9 2023 I deposited $6,300 and took pictures all along the way, they even sent me a confirmation that my money was deposited, but never made it to my Bitcoin wallet.  I need that money so badly and no response from anyone.  If anyone is putting a class action suite against CoinCloud please let me know or if anyone knows how I can get my money back, I would really appreciate the help!!!!! helfrichkarin at the gmail"

I have emailed them texted them and I get nothing their support phone just hangs up on you and no chat support cause their web services don't work it in now Aug 8 2023 and still no one has contacted me I have sent a bunch of emails to them and get no response.

726,1116,Coin Cloud,This company is the worse.  I’ve asked for my money back several times and now it seems my money has disappeared.  I’ve contacted the Federal Trade Commission. You cannot reach this company by phone. The website isn’t working.  I suggest you get your attorney lined up now. They will keep your money. Oh they have been working on the app.  Nothing works.  But they can still seem to deduct money due them from your account.
727,1116,Coin Cloud,there are many types of crypto scams and we do everything we can to make sure our customers are prepared and educated in the event they find themselves in any of these situations. Our kiosk does state that Coin Cloud is not a money sending service & you must be the owner of your wallet to transact at our Kiosk. Please email us at fredstanly01 with your information associated with the transaction and our team will assist you with the next steps.
728,1116,Coin Cloud,Customer service can be better. Your feed is way too highand your promotion code u dont stand behind it. I had given u over $20 000 of my business and got $25 out of your promo codes which most of the time it doesn't even work. Common get your promotion together. I am actually turn to Rockitcoin cause of this situation. Big dissapointed in the operation your company is running.
729,1116,Coin Cloud,So here we go again I should’ve known better but I guess it takes me three times to finally learn my lesson that coin cloud just isn’t what they say they are they are a company that just filed bankruptcy but their ATMs are still in our local stores taking our cash promising cryptocurrency but not delivering and when you call or try to chat or try to email it’s an answering machine or robot or Automatic email I went to go on the Better Business Bureau site to write a complaint only to read 100 complaints before meI really wish someone would stop this business I’m taking any more of our cash
730,1116,Coin Cloud,"Same experience as the first poster, A B. Machines just eat your cash and never give you any crypto. Surprisingly, the customer service agents actually answer (probably in a boiler room) but tell you a glitch is preventing the crypto from being released. Total ponzi/outright scam.EDIT: the company finally followed up and sent me a refund in BTC"
731,1116,Coin Cloud,Lying crooks.I sent btc and never received it My new mission is to make to sure I contact every single retailer that has coin cloud and makes sure they remove the machines immediately. Reputable retailers are being lied to by CoinCloud and unknowingly assisting them in defrauding their own customers.If anyone is interested in a class action lawsuits please email my Gmail account. Site won't let me add full email address but it's Gmail.com just add @ after  junekooming
732,1116,Coin Cloud,Hello. I bought btc at coincloud atm and i haven't seen it in my wallet since 2 days now. But when i call support they said the btc was received in my wallet which is false. I check on the blockchain explorer it shows its showing there as balance my there is zero on my wallet. I need help to recover this btc to show in my wallet
733,1116,Coin Cloud,I’ve used this particular crypto atm 5 or 6 times given its at the end of my block in playa del Rey. 2 out of 5/6 times the money literally just never went into my wallet and it’s also hit & somehow just disappeared ( no my account was never hacked ) & the other bad thing is that it takes over an hour (which is fine) but the machine claims no longer than a few minutes
734,1116,Coin Cloud,"I recently started investing in crypto and was super excited to find a Bitcoin ATM at Tivoli Village during my weekend shopping!I had some simple questions and called the customer service number. I spoke to Maya who was very kind. Overall, the machine required my phone number and a bitcoin wallet and was a simple experience. I’ll definitely be back!"
735,1116,Coin Cloud,"None of their machines ever have cash when you go to sell. Made a our chase on Saturday, nothing yet. Address still shows 0 transactions, like it’s still not even waiting for confirmation 4 days later. Phone message changes everyday including today alleging they would be there today (12/27/22) but I keep getting the same message. Thankfully this led me to cashapp which is much cheaper and easier to buy btc."
736,1116,Coin Cloud,Found it simple and easy to buy and sell my crypto. Money was in my wallet within minuetes. Definitely recommend especially since the cash out feature is immediate and on the spot. Customer service also always seems to sort out any questions or concerns I have.
737,1116,Coin Cloud,Bought btc for 2weeks and dime days now and I’ve not received anything yet to today. They keep telling me they’re upgrading and I want to know when the upgrading will last?
738,1116,Coin Cloud,Everytime i go to send bitcoin to a friend I have to sometimes go to three different machines because they are always broken.  It’s a pain but it’s the only way my boyfriend can receive money at this time.  Usually the machine that I find that works is 20 miles from my house. And it becomes a nuisance to have to keep driving all over town to find a machine that works.
739,1116,Coin Cloud,"Within the last 18mos or longer regardless of either atm my funds are ""normally"" confirmed within 30mins or less. Earlier today I purchased using Coincloud atm, I recieved a txt saying it ""will"" be confirmed in appr. 47mins. It is going on 9hrs and still no confirmation.I have spoken with Customer Service twice since.Nothing"
740,1116,Coin Cloud,"Really bad. Deposited 114$ USD, got worth 90$ in Bitcoin and out of that I was charged a 61 dollar fee. That’s over 50% of money lost simply from getting a fee on the transaction. Never would have even thought of depositing that if I knew I was just throwing my money down the drain. Don’t use these unless you want to lose hard earned money."
741,1116,Coin Cloud,SCAM! flush your money down the toilet before giving these people a penny of your money! They will take your money and make you wait days for a simple transaction. Any other btc ATM sends money immediately. For some reason this company can't handle a simple task such as sending a transaction. They'll take your money but they won't send your coin. Never use them they are absolute scam artists who suck at their job.Thanks for the below reply however waiting for 10 hours on hold or got a call back is NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE. It's a stall tactic if you can't deliver the service then don't take people's money Period
742,1116,Coin Cloud,"Previous purchases went smoothly  Always sent Bitcoin to wallet in same day. But this last time last week, their customer service would tell me it says 1-3 days on machine. I believe machine said may take 24 hours  . But then 3 days later, with no coin in wallet, I get onto Blockchain and my wallet address is nowhere to be seen. Instead it is someone else's wallet address and they have taken my deposit and handed it out to a dozen other addresses. I have threatened to sue them and I still don't hear anything from them. Run away, do not use them unless you feel like gambling and don't mind losing"
743,1116,Coin Cloud,"For 3weeks now I purchased a coin from one of their ATM in Minnesota and till now i still haven’t get my coin have called, emailed everyday but I couldn’t get through to them, please i don’t know how to get my coin or my money back I can’t just let them runaway with my $3500"
744,1116,Coin Cloud,"Do not use unless you want your money stolen. They are no better than the Indians running call center scams. It's unbelievable that they are allowed to stay in business.They will respond to my review here with something like, ""sorry your experience was not up to our standards BLAH BLAH BLAH, please call us at xxx-xxx-xxxx so we can resolve your issue.""LIESThey will not resolve your issue. You will be in a perpetual loop of calling and texting and emailing them. They do not care about customer service because there is an endless flow of people who will innocently try to use their machine and hand money over to them. This is sick and needs to stop. I emailed the guy in another review who wants to start a class-action lawsuit. Anyone else with issues, I suggest you do the same."
745,1116,Coin Cloud,I used the Coin Cloud machine but the screen wasn’t reading my phones QR code so I called the number. Their customer service agent was really nice and helped me figure out. They also gave me a discount to use next time. Great service and even better customer service.
746,1116,Coin Cloud,Horrible experience.  They advertise 10-15 min turnaround on BTC withdraw. I sent the funds from my Kraken over 5 hours ago now and the funds are still not available.  I've called customer service 5 times sofar and they only apologize and claim that they will push it through as they are unsure what the hold-up is at this point.
747,1116,Coin Cloud,"Never use this service. Put money in and had to call 9 times in 24 hour period to recover my money. They deducted 20% for my deposit transaction, and they don’t allow third party transactions. Too complicated, broken system with poor communication"
748,1116,Coin Cloud,I have used Coin Cloud machines a few times and have had nothing but good things to say about the services. The customer service representatives have always been available and the locations are conveniently located. I can honestly thank Coin Cloud for educating me a lot about digital currency and the blockchain.
749,1116,Coin Cloud,"I was dismayed to find out that the machine I used (I was told) was not a bit coin machine. I took advantage of the promo code for 23% off charges, but was actually charged 25% instead. I was disappointed as was the recipient of the transfer when 25% was taken out for fees."
750,1116,Coin Cloud,Scammed by someone claiming to be policerJairo Pichardo . I was scammed 900.00 dollars He he was special agent U.S. marshals office. Said it was complete a   psychiatric evaluation. Or I would be addressed3479209028
751,1116,Coin Cloud,I have used other BTC ATMs but this one has multiple locations in Texas and makes easier for me to use them when I need. Just bought BTC and ETH and both transactions finished in minutes…
752,1116,Coin Cloud,I bought bitcoin at the machine it’s been 2 days now and I haven’t received value for my purchase. This used to be a trustworthy company but now seem like a whole lot of gimmicks going on. I even tried calling and I’ve been on the phone more then 2hrs waiting to talk to someone I’m so worried now
753,1116,Coin Cloud,"They advertise that you can sell bitcoin at their ATMs. Tried 3 different ones, none worked. Yes I do have wallet with them. Yes it has funds. No I can not find an ATM from coincloud that will give me cash. Tried calling customer service. Maybe they will call me before I retire, but I doubt it."
754,1116,Coin Cloud,"I'd give them a 0 but that wasn't an option. I've put thousands of dollars into their ATM to convert into Bitcoin. They've always been the SLOWEST to send Bitcoin and the most expensive.  Yesterday I put 100$ in the machine, almost 24 hours later still no Bitcoin. Customer service couldn't give me a time frame and tried to put the blame on me. Now they won't even respond.  I see that their stock has tanked overnight and hopefully with this review I can get my money's worth and save some other poor soul from making the stupid decision I did and use a coin cloud atm! I hope in the near future your atms won't even be worth their weight in scrap!!Ladies and Gentlemen, PLEASE DO NOT USE COIN CLOUD!"
755,1116,Coin Cloud,"I tried to purchase $1,000 worth of USDTOne machine would not accept my moneyI went to a different machine, I put in exactly $1,000 and it told me I only put in $980... Then I had to wait. Someone called me to verify my info. I waited hours, nothing in my wallet.. then I got a text about my buy transaction being ""expired"".... I attempted to called 9 times, waiting in line to speak to someone, no one ever called back, I never got another text, and I'm out $960!!!!!! I am livid at this company."
756,1116,Coin Cloud,"I spend more time each month contacting them because they haven't paid than I'd prefer.  They removed a machine from one location after telling me they would not be removing it.  We then had a break in at another location and a week later the machine still sits here mangled and unusable while my customers ask when they'll be able to use it.  I canceled the contract with them after a lady spent 3 days trying to get the machine to work (no fault of her own, blurry camera) she then spent $25000 and bought Bitcoin.  Coin cloud stated that the machine wasn't profitable and was very rude over the phone.  I told them to come get the equipment and pay me the money owed.  Worst Company I've dealt with in a long time.  They don't communicate with each other and tell you something different every time you call in."
757,1116,Coin Cloud,i bought litecoin at one of thier atm's and its been 10 hours adn i finally got a reply saying that it will be two more days wth it said 15 minute on the atm horrible do not buy from coin cloud
758,1116,Coin Cloud,I can't really say anything bad as of yet but I was frustrated because they refused to help me recover my password. I understand the security concerns but what good is the $500 I won in BITCOIN if I can't get into my account?
759,1116,Coin Cloud,It has been over 50 hours and they still have not placed my transaction in the blockchain. Everywhere online says they fired 50% of there staff and are going out of business soon. They clearly don't have the funds to pay people there money and it is clear they are going bankrupt soon. Do not use their atm.Friday 10/28/22 still nothing and when I called customer service they stated there is nothing they can do and if I wanted to file a complaint then I could do that on their website. This company needs to be investigated and then prosecuted.If you think writing a reply and talking about how your business can't handle the transactions from your customer because you just cut a bunch of your staff member then you probably should consider closing your doors so you don't have to make excuses for the way you treat your customers.
760,1116,Coin Cloud,This company used to be a reasonably priced quick alternative to bank transfers. They have now gone down hill and I will never use them again. They take days to send out funds. Do yourself a favor and use an alternate route for crypto.
761,1116,Coin Cloud,"Coincloud are thieves. While they have been jacking up their ATM rates recently, I still decided to use them but they double charged me and the final commission came out to 20.8%.  They agree it was a mistake but after one week they still won’t refund the over charge and want to wait until their “product team” figures out why.  Not my problem why it happened and everyone in CoinCloud agrees it was their mistake.  Give me back my money. Find another BTC ATM"
762,1116,Coin Cloud,Improve your whole platform 32 hours now your system down can’t live chat no one answers the phones all of sudden sick of waiting for my cash
763,1116,Coin Cloud,"I deposited $2100 into machine and about an hour later learned that I was charged a 22% fee for using machine to purchase Bitcoin. $462 in fees, that was never shown on machine that I’m aware of"
764,1116,Coin Cloud,I used to love CoinCloud. My local ATM was only 6% in fees and the transfer happened in minutes. Now their rates have been jacked up to 19.94% and if you see your bitcoin in the less than 24 hours you’re winning.  We all know what can happen to BTC price in 24 hours. These guys have changed their interface in the past few months and this seems to be the trigger for most of their problems.  I have used their machines extensively the past few years but they have lost me as a customer given the outrageous fees they are charging and the time it takes them to proceed transactions.
765,1116,Coin Cloud,"As a suggestion, would be nice if the transaction were instant, like most other competitors. That would be one of the most annoying things about coincloud, taking very long to transfer the funds."
766,1116,Coin Cloud,"I sent money to friends recently. $240 became $190 after Coin Cloud processed it, a ridiculous amount to my thinking and very disappointing to both friend and I."
767,1116,Coin Cloud,on august 7th i made a transaction at 730am.its august 9th and my transaction never went thru.i have made ahundred transactions in the past and never had to wait for it to go thru.the empkoyees tell me my transaction will go thru in one hour and nithing hapoens.why are they lying?is my transaction ever going to go thru 2days come on.
768,1116,Coin Cloud,"Used a CoinCloud ATM with a promo code. It took almost 20 hours between using the ATM and getting the funds in my wallet. Used promo code for 20%-off fees, and did not receive 20% off of fees. Horrible company, horrible service, and they love to lie to their customers!"
769,1116,Coin Cloud,Company is going under they just laid half of their staff which means they’re going to in no time go out of business. They are 15 business days behind from paying out
770,1116,Coin Cloud,I was disappointed bc after I entered the code the machine just froze up and I have to call them to tell them about it and I was told it would take 3 hours to fix it and that was like it 8:30 or 9am today
771,1116,Coin Cloud,"First of all the code given to my in my previous review did not work the day after it was given.I went to four different places yesterday and none of them were working, with these issues:1. ""Out-of-service"" (been that way for a month, I have told them).2. Would not send me a code via text or call to my phone after I entered my number.3. The image on screen was rotated 90 degrees and was unusable.4. The screen was showing a Windows desktop instead of the start screen.This is ridiculous for the high, 20% fee I must pay to use these machines.As for calling in advance, there's at least a 30 minute hold every time I tried to call.I wish I had an alternative at this point."
772,1116,Coin Cloud,Wish I read the reviews before using coin cloud. They have to be on the brink of closing up shop based on the latest reviews.  “Deposited” money 16 hours ago and still have yet to receive it. I use other Crypto ATMs all the time and have never had a problem. As a matter of fact I used one today and had it confirmed within 30 minutes. This is the first and last time I will be using Coin Cloud.  I’m questioning if I will even receive my money at this point.
773,1116,Coin Cloud,"I should have learned my lesson last time I used coin cloud.  I used to love this company.  Fees were always a bit more expensive than some others but the coin came in fast so it was worth it to me.  A few weeks ago I made a smaller purchase and it took over 24 hours to show up (never received text message during confirmation so I’m still not 100 percent I ever did receive my money) I use a couple different companies and it might have been one of those transactions that actually came in. I emailed coin cloud but received no response and then today, I wasn’t thinking and used their atm again.  It was only 100 bucks but again, I have received no message regarding my transaction so I have no clue if or when it will show up in my wallet. No notice on the screen of delayed times or anything.  Just really getting pissed off.  I could have waited 20 minutes to use the other btc atm by my house and saved a few bucks and already have had my coin. Just really going downhill lately.  Please be smart and use a different company until these guys get their crap together."
774,1116,Coin Cloud,"Takes too long, drive down the street and you’ll have your transaction processed within minutes at any other type of bitcoin ATM"
775,1116,Coin Cloud,Again I have been Banboozled!!! I have had delayed coin issues before with this company and I was thinking I was smart by calling ahead of my purchase and I was told no delays today. Now that I’ve finally got through on customer service they are saying they were having delays. When I explained to the agent that I called first Ulisess G told me that they have signs posted on the machine to tell the customer that there will be delayed… I’ve only seen the words FAST and EASY and not the words up to 24-48 hour delays when purchasing from our machine I’m beyond frustrated because I could have used another machine or another avenue for my purchase. Now I’m out the money until it shows up tomorrow the next banking day after 5pm…. It’s the weekend and it takes my money to be used by this company at a fee I mind you….. I’m sick to my stomach over this Lmc
776,1116,Coin Cloud,"Their atm is becoming a trash, looks like you are trying to scam people off their money. I bought Bitcoin $3000 with promo code COINCLOUD22 using your atm in Bristol VA Sep 24th. its past 24 hours and I am yet to receive the bitcoin in my wallet. I have contacted the support on the phone and all the rep is trying to do is make it seem it was my fault. How is it my fault that I'm yet to receive my coin for over 24 hours ? This is not the first time I get to use an atm. You do need to resolve this issues as there has been a lot of complaints otherwise you will lose lots of business. I need my bitcoin in my Wallet. I am going to have this review posted everywhere."
777,1116,Coin Cloud,"Used their ATM, today @9am. Money still hasn’t been loaded to my account 11:30am. They sent a saying my transaction id has expired tried calling around but to no avail. Seeing all of these bad reviews have me scared"
778,1116,Coin Cloud,"First of all I've used coincloud machines before and their rates are kind of ridiculously high and service is usually slower than any other Bitcoin ATM, but I used them again yesterday at 4A.M. I sent 40.00 in Bitcoin to an address and here we are 12:27a.m. the next day and still I have not received my Bitcoin. My Girlfriend also sent 40.00 right after me and she still haven't received her Bitcoin either. This is beyond ridiculous. How are they still in business? I called customer service and was told I should receive my Bitcoin later today sometime, no particular time frame or anything just later today sometime. This seems like straight robbery to me. How do you pay the highest rates for the slowest service that is so backwards to me. If you need your Bitcoin sent at a reasonable time like that day in particular, I don't recommend using coin cloud unless you have a couple days to spare and your not worried about time and don't mind spending extra money to wait."
779,1116,Coin Cloud,"Very poor service. And it’s very unreliable, i made a payments to my wallet and itself over 2 days now and I haven’t seen the coin or my money, this is equivalent to fraud😡😡"
780,1116,Coin Cloud,What’s happening between your wallet and blockchain more than 30hours now I haven’t receive my funds from coincloud
781,1116,Coin Cloud,Coin Cloud scammed me of $13800.Funds went into my wallet in the old app.My AT&T updated to their new app.  My old app is no longer available.  The wallet didn’t transfer.  Their customer service tried to help for over a week without results.  I asked to be put in touch with their software team.  No can do!  They can’t talk to a member of the public.  I have paid them thousands in commissions over the last year.  Stay clear of Coincloud.
782,1116,Coin Cloud,This is one of the worst companies I've ever ever worked for. They were unprepared for like 6/6 jobs! Wrong codes every single time and gave me a 2 1 star reviews after how bad their customer service was
783,1116,Coin Cloud,"Please I mistakenly sent my coin to your address please can you guys help me refund it back please, I have all the transactions prove"
784,1116,Coin Cloud,"On April 18, I was scammed and I reached out to you right away to cancel/freeze the transaction, but you weren't reachable and you still haven't responded to my email."
785,1116,Coin Cloud,"It seems every time the price is going up and I put money in, it takes days to get to me. This is the last time. I’m missing out on money because it takes days to get my coin. Just make the time estimate accurate whether that means boosting it from 30 minutes or telling us it will take forever. Terrible way to get coin just avoid it."
786,1116,Coin Cloud,"It was confusing I didn’t know which icon to choose for bitcoin, wouldn’t it be better to say bitcoin on the icon?"
787,1116,Coin Cloud,"This company is a scam they don’t pay their location owner, how do you make a contract with someone and state they gonna pay monthly for have the machine in your location and not pay?"
788,1116,Coin Cloud,"Actually the machine I was using is working smoothly, but after that I just know I need to pay fees, and charge is too high almost 22%, it is not good at all, I am not suggest people use this way to buy coins if you don't want to lose your money, it is not worth it."
789,1116,Coin Cloud,"Used the machine at Tivoli Village in Las Vegas. Was pretty easy to purchase bitcoin. Make sure you have a wallet. If not, you can download theirs in the App Store."
790,1116,Coin Cloud,Pitiful rode all around town trying to get my moneyNo machine had $Customer service is horrible
791,1116,Coin Cloud,I used coincloud atm. Over 5 hours I haven’t received my bitcoin and received a message my purchase got expired.
792,1116,Coin Cloud,Bought Bitcoin been 5 days still have not received.UpdateJuly 18 2023 and I still have not received .
793,1116,Coin Cloud,Yes I'd like using the machine for the convenience of buying bitcoin but there are way too many charges associated with those transactions
794,1116,Coin Cloud,Using CC has been great. Very convenient and once your ID is verified the flexibility is awesome.
795,1116,Coin Cloud,"Can only buy $20 without an ID.I shouldn't have to upload my ID to buy more than $20 from an atm. this is stupid. what will I do with $20???? you have lost a customer, drove over an hour to a location just to have this happen. spent more on gas alone."
796,1116,Coin Cloud,Horrible. It's been 24 hours and still haven't received my bitcoin. I called and they use the same lies they used in the past. Worst experience I ever had moving crypto. Stay away from coin cloud
797,1116,Coin Cloud,Terrible service they didn’t even give me a reference number.  Waiting to be called back I think they stole my money
798,1116,Coin Cloud,I purchased a bitcoin of $550 bitcoin yesterday 1:33pm and It hasn’t come through my wallet address till now
799,1116,Coin Cloud,I have always made my transfers to my husband overseas using coin cloud. It makes it easy and stress free
800,1116,Coin Cloud,I agree they are garbage. Been waiting close to 2 hours still haven't received my coins.Currently the rate for Bitcoin cash is $109 online. They charged me $142 plus $5 service fee. I'm now waiting 2 hours I still don't have them in my wallet.(could have purchased them online with my debit card and literally had them in my wallet within 5 minutes) (why I didn't just do that like always I have no idea) (I think I just wanted to test out one of the ATMs and see what they were like) (I was also supposed to have a 25% off code and I entered it and it refused to take it even though it came directly from their website)On top of that no matter how much you buy you have to go through this absurd verification procedure with your driver's license and pictures. Completely off the wall.It's no wonder store owners around here are taking out there ATMs and putting in their competitors.I feel like an idiot that I just didn't go online and use an online exchange and pay a five or seven percent premium as opposed to what's turning out to be a 50% premium (assuming I actually ever get my freaking coins)I call in to see where my coins are in the ladies literally said to me what is bitcoin cash?Like what are you talking about I gave you a Bitcoin cash address and I chose altcoins and your receipt even says you're sending me Bitcoin cash.She says to me oh I didn't know our wallet is Bitcoin so we have to go buy them and send them to you so it could take a few hours.I would highly recommend you avoid using this company.
801,1116,Coin Cloud,"the atm in my area advertises an extra $20 in btc for every $100 purchased, I purchased $100 and did not receive any extra, on top of that, they quoted the price of btc $3k higher than actual price and only ended up receiving $87 in bitcoin."
802,1116,Coin Cloud,Only used your atm because the weather won't let me drive further away to a different agent. Dreadful.
803,1116,Coin Cloud,"They’re bunch of thieves, do not use their atm to buy or sell bitcoin It’s been 3 days and I never receive my bitcoin in my wallet"
804,1116,Coin Cloud,The last transaction I made was made to my wallet quicker than usual in the past I have had issues with it taking longer be processed sometimes the next day sometimes I've had it three or four days later actually I like going to the ATM by which they were machine where a little faster
805,1116,Coin Cloud,"Great experience, was able to sell my crypto and get cash in minutes. Highly recommend."
806,1116,Coin Cloud,Why does their website they say a atm transaction is 10 minutes but it been almost 40 minutes and never got my money like I have to get this money at a specific time and am waiting but never got it so I don’t if they took my money or it’s just Sunday and they don’t work in Sunday’s

808,1116,Coin Cloud,"Coincloud use to be the ""only"" bitcoin atm machine in my area. Now there's several different brands. Some have lower fees some have higher. As ""most"" people are aware, processing times are ""mostly"" determined by the blockchain. Within the last 18mos or longer regardless of either atm my funds are ""normally"" confirmed within 30mins or less. Earlier today I purchased using Coincloud atm, I recieved a txt saying it ""will"" be confirmed in appr. 47mins. It is going on 9hrs and still no confirmation. I have spoken with Customer Service twice since.The 1st thing they will tell you ""regardless"" of your reason to call is:1. It can take up to 24hrs2. It depends on hw busy the blockchain is which is true to a certain degree.What they ""wont"" tell u is 1. Coincloud Atm machines have not been operating smoothly within the last year or so. 2. Your wait time is ""NOT"" because of the ""normal"" processing times but because of a technical glitch in there systems. Who buys bitcoin expecting it not to be processed til the nxt day? They are trained to tell you a bunch of bs that doesn't make sense. Try asking to speak to a manager or supervisor and see how far that takes you. THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SPEAK TO ANYONE IN UPPER MANAGEMENT. Which moreso pisses me off. This isnt my 1st time having UNUSUALLY LONG PROCESSING TIMES ALONG WITH HIGHER THAN NORMAL FEES but I can assure you Mr. Coincloud, it'll be my last. For those looking for LOWER fees and FAST confirmations w/o having to use a dam code try Googling COINFLIP ATMS in your area, they're in ""most"" 7/11 convenience stores and most Pittstop gas stations.Coincloud has proven to me once again that my business isn't valued. I'd rather pay a higher fee and wait 48hrs versus using a dam code because there fees are 2dam high and not owning up that their machines are not working properly. Ez fix, ADMIT your errors and do WHATEVER you need to do to keep from losing a customer. (I will be copy pasting this post everywhere I can).Thanks for reading.*AND AS FOR YOUR REPLY WISHING ME THE BEST OF LUCK, IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH LUCK WITH YOUR UNEDUCATED CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS AND RIDICULOUSLY HIGH FEES THAT YOU BLAME ON MINERS, NOT TO MENTION THE 10HOUR PROCESSING TIMES THAT YOU BLAME ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. THIS POST IS ONLY INTENDED TO MAKE PEOPLE FULLY AWARE WHAT THEY'RE IN FOR IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT USING YOUR WALLET OR YOUR ATM. * My apologies if it seems as if you've read this post before, you probably have, I'm doing my best to repost this everywhere including ALL social media platforms. Thanks for reading and I wish you the best of luck in replying to them all.😉"
809,1116,Coin Cloud,Do not use this bitcoin atm! They will scam you out of money and the customer service people are horrible!!! Do not use this!!!!! I repeat do not use this place!!!!!!!
810,1116,Coin Cloud,Coin cloud is awful. Used they slow ass machine at 8am still haven’t got my bitcoin it’s 3pm. like come tf on
811,1116,Coin Cloud,Been 29 hours now my bitcoin haven’t arrive at my wallet
812,1116,Coin Cloud,Rip off.  Fees are insane.  Had promo code that wouldn't work.   Never again
813,1116,Coin Cloud,"I’ve purchase bitcoin through coin cloud bitcoin machine in Florida on Friday noon, and till now I’ve not receive no coin my wallet, please is there any who have experience such before and hope I’ll still receive my coin, I’ve called them and all they’re saying is I should wait I was told that it will get in yesterday but till now still the same, I don’t understand your service or what’s going on, I’ve send them email and attached images as references, please look into this I don’t receive anything yet"
814,1116,Coin Cloud,"I have never had such a bad experience with any other Bitcoin company until this one I have been waiting on a ATM deposit I made now for four days and still haven't received my deposit cleared they have continued to say it's gonna be there next business day and nothing poor customer service , slow process and overall just a terrible experience!!"
815,1116,Coin Cloud,How long does it take for my money to be mail back to me
816,1116,Coin Cloud,Very fast and easy. Bought Bitcoin in 2 minutes start to finish.
817,1116,Coin Cloud,The money insert it too low you need to bend over to feed it
818,1116,Coin Cloud,"Absolutely awful experience. And I’ve not once taken the time to write a negative review for any company or service because I’m pretty lenient, and like to think of everyone as human and capable of mistakes. But this place needs to get their s**t together. Seems like most reviews show they’ve had bad experiences buying bitcoin, well I’ve had a pretty bad one trying to sell mine for cash. After searching online for hours which ATM allows you to SELL bitcoin, I came across these guys. Went to a kiosk, and tried to sell $1000 worth of bitcoin. Everything looked good, it gave me a QR code to send the BTC to, and after I sent it I received a link to my phone to track the status. Went and sat in my car for about 30 mins til the BTC transaction was fully confirmed, then got a text saying the cash was ready for pickup and to go back to the kiosk. Went back, and was told by the kiosk screen they can’t complete the transaction because the kiosk doesn’t have the cash available. OH COOL, so there isn’t a system in place to prevent me from starting a transaction that they can’t fulfill? Weird. Anyways…. The kiosk then gives me a drop down menu of other kiosks in the area that have the available cash, so it “transfers” the transaction to the other kiosk I choose. Found one that was 20 minutes away… so I chose that one. I drive there, excited to finally finish this mess. Guess what? Same error! You’ve got to be sh*tting me. No cash in the machine. It gives me the same prompt “please select another location”. Unfortunately now the nearest location is further away, about 35 minutes backwards from where I live… so I call their support team and explain the issue. I said “listen, I only want to drive to this other location if you can absolutely guarantee me that this kiosk actually has the funds to give me”. They assured me it did and that it’s rare for a machine to not have the available cash. Funny cause it already happened twice. Before I leave, silly me decides to try another transaction for $500, hopeful that maybe the machine was maybe short in cash but had enough to do $500. I sent the btc and get the same error even after it does tell me it has enough cash to complete the $500. Now I’ve got $1500 missing and need to recover. Anyways, I take the drive, finally get there, and I get another similar BS error. Tried twice just to make sure it wasn’t an error with my phone. Nope, sure enough their system is just really whack and yet again it doesn’t have the cash. Now I’m annoyed. 2 hours of driving, all while the price of bitcoin is dropping in value and I can’t complete this damn thing. I get home and after waiting on hold  with their support team, they keep trying to give me alternative locations to pick up the cash. I politely tell them I’ve had enough and I can’t risk making more drives to empty machines. At this point I honestly think I’m getting scammed. The support member mentions she can refund me, asks for my btc address, and I reply to a text with the info. After getting put on hold for another 5 mins she comes back saying she talked to her team and since the transaction is in “this status” I’m not entitled to a refund. Now I’m really about to kiss my money goodbye. How am I not entitled to a refund if the original agreement wasn’t satisfied? Should it be my responsibility to go drive another hour out of state to find a machine that MIGHT (emphasis on the might part) actually have my cash? I think I’ve been more than patient enough at this point by driving to 3 locations, most would already be furious after the first one. I explain I really need this fixed somehow because I have no other options and to please help me. I get put on hold again for 20 mins then am told they processed the refund. I was nervous at first, and was told it might take 24 hours to receive. But at this point, I already considered the money gone so figured if a refund hits, GREAT. If not, I guess it’s my fault for not being smarter. I’m happy to report that this morning I DID receive my refund. When I woke up I almost decided to not leave a negative review, however, the absolutely ridiculous BS hoops I had to jump through to get my money back is not okay, and I hope someone sees this review and gives it thought before going through the same crap I did. 1 star for the fact I did get a refund, but 0 stars on every other aspect. DONT ALLOW YOUR MACHINES TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS IF THEY CANT FULFILL THEM. I can’t be the first or the last person this happens to. This company could have a lot of potential, the machines themselves look great, they’re easy to navigate, they look smooth and modern and inviting, unlike the old ugly ATMs you see at the gas stations. But guess what? I’ve used those old ugly btc ATMs that charge crappy fees, and they dispensed my cash within 5 seconds… I’ll keep going there and not get sucked into another 5 hours of BS like this company did me. BEWARE PPL"
819,1116,Coin Cloud,Easy to use. The location is very easy to get to.
820,1116,Coin Cloud,Quick bitcoin with cash.
821,1116,Coin Cloud,"Coincloud needs to figure things out. They have gone downhill really fast. Loved them at first but lately they have been the worst Bitcoin company out there. Over just 10 days 3 transactions took a long time, not just hours but days. First transaction took 12 hours, 4 days later I made purchase on Friday and received it Tuesday and now once again made a purchase last night and 8 hours later still nothing. What really angers me is their site stating that most transactions take 15 mins but on RARE occasions, can take up to a hour. What is rare now a days is getting it under 8 hours. And I did my own little test and while waiting, I went to 2 other Bitcoin machines with other companies and had the Bitcoin in minutes. So how can other companies have it out in minutes and you guys take 4 days? And if you are going to be so slow, TELL PEOPLE, so we can go somewhere else. No notice on machine about any possible delays. Company obviously doesn't seem too concerned seeing how many other ppl are staying the same issues. When it takes longer than my bank, it defeats the whole purpose. Hopefully the company will get someone in charge who cares enough to figure out why they are only Bitcoin to have huge delays and fix the issue"

828,119,Cash Express,"I went into cash express on Eastern Bypass. I went in early because I got my check early. I ask the girl who waited on me if it would be a problem paying early. She says no, I don't see a problem with it. So I reborrow, after paying. Next month comes and a different girl calls and says I am down to pay that day. I said I don't get my check till the first and the 3rd. She says we'll the 3rd is 4 days out. I said well I get a check the first also and that is 2 days out. She says well your check may be here when you come or it may not be. I said well do what ever you have to but I don't get paid till the first and 3rd. Can come in the first. So today I look at my bank account and sure enough she had turned it in and it's pending. I don't care mind you but the other girl had told me it would be fine. This dark haired girl that called me has always been so hateful. I always avoid having to deal with her and always go to the other register. The black haired girl is a very pretty girl but her attitude and personality and hatefulness does not go with her beauty. But how is one worker saying one thing and another worker saying another helping at all. I been going there for a few years. I will be finding another location.  I will go to the one on Main Street. Evidently paying early makes a whole lot of difference."

850,1118,PNC Bank,I was completely mislead when applying for a credit card to consolidate. I would have never allowed them to go through the process of applying etc had they truly cared to make sure of my needs. I have had great experiences with the bank in the past but this was a true letdown. I have banked with them for years and even have a car loan with them. I advise anyone to choose a different bank. PNC is definitely not what is was.
851,1118,PNC Bank,"First, there isn't a full-service PNC Bank that isn't 22 -24 minutes away from me. Second, the PNC mobile app seldom works. It takes very few checks, but not others. I have to take checks to the nearest ATM to deposit them physically. For a business, this is a considerable inconvenience. When first approached by PNC, they told me they had no problems with mobile deposits; everything would be fine. Since day 1, I've had problems; shame on me; it's a year later, and I am ready to move on."

I get to the branch in Livermore CA where they have removed all tellers and hired a bunch of people that are there to make sure the chairs stay warm.  They did not have a clue on how to close the account. They in turn told me that I had to call the phone number for the bank to get help.  I was a bit upset when I was told the number to get help, that has made up my mind to go back to my old bank.   They have lost my business and I will tell my friends to stop using PNC for banking."
853,1118,PNC Bank,I went to the PNC counter in a local supermarket for the convenience. Waited in line for the one slow bank employee. Had to repeat my request several times because the teller couldn't understand what I was talking about. There was an error in my account. Not difficult to understand. Took my information but couldn't fix the problem at that time. Had to phone another employee because no one got back to me. Closed my account within 3 months.
854,1118,PNC Bank,"The worst bank ever. We have been trying for 2 weeks to wire transfer funds we have from PNC to our official bank, and the bank literally can't follow instructions from our receiving bank to do this. We can't get our money, and the English language seems to be quite stumbling block for them. Once the account is closed, we will never ever use them again."
855,1118,PNC Bank,"I wasted time phoning and getting the run around trying to close my accounts so I enrolled the help of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They were fantastic and they assured everyone that my accounts would be closed and monies refunded.My bank cannot clear the checks as “the clearing bank as the clearing bank states there is a “MISMATCH ROUTING NUMBER”!!,Yet another ploy by PNC Bank to hold my money.Disgraceful!!!!Not dealing with them anymore and I will be switching to Asllc who are professional with managing my finances"
856,1118,PNC Bank,I would never recommend pnc they make it very hard to close a account and make it hard to work with them on things I only have one location in my area used to have 2 how ever they closed it and I walk every where and the one open is not in a safe place to walk to I have been trying to get it closed for 3 days and have been fighting with them over it. I Would strongly not recommend them they also have not been telling the truth the last few days
857,1118,PNC Bank,This bank is a disgrace. When I left the US I requested they close my credit card account. One week later a charge was put on this account by my former cell phone provider. I called and they informed me that the account was not closed it was only frozen and that the charge still stands. They now want me to pay that charge with interest because they would not close my account when requested. Not happening. I don't even live in that country anymore.
858,1118,PNC Bank,"I have had numerous horrible problems with this bank. Where to begin??? I wrote a check - they refused to honor it because - get this - I didn't use the same *pen* to write the check as I signed up for an account with... said it was obviously ""forged"" since the pen was different and I got a lecture about using the same pen... Told they require me to keep a *million* dollars in my account or I can't have any info about what is in the account... REALLY??? And now I am trying to close the account, and they won't transfer my money to another bank. I've been trying for two weeks and they say they don't know how to do it. I can't write checks on the account, I can't use it, and I can't get my money out. They are complete !d!ots of the first order. They must have to pass a Stupid Test to work there... Worst Bank Ever - like EVER!!!!!"
859,1118,PNC Bank,"The one an only teller was friendly and personable to a degree and that's the only reason for the one star. When you are a customer and want to talk with an actual banker no one is ever available. Should have realized when I had to make an appointment 5 days in advance to open an account that this bank was severely understaffed. I've had an car loan there for years and normally pay by check with no problem. On one occasion I didn't have a check with so I went inside to pay with a debit card at which point I had show proof of identification because I didn't have an account with them. That was after standing in line for 30 minutes. Stupidly I opened a checking account with them. I sold a piece of property for $100,000 I went with the check at 1:00 on Friday afternoon and was told the banker was out for lunch and to return later that afternoon. I did return that afternoon and waited awhile before being told come back Monday. The teller said she was having “issues”. All I needed was 5 minutes of her time to advise me. Promptly went to another bank that wasn't having “issues” and opened an account. Somethings you don't want to talk to a teller about especially when she is the only one and dividing her time between the drive-thru as well as working the counter. I fully realize that my $100 Grand is nothing to a bank worth billions but it's important to me. It's probably not her fault or the staff's fault but the lack of any help. Sorry I ever went to PNC. Planning to draw this account down and let this account slowly evaporate as I see from these reviews that it is almost impossible to close an account with PNC. I've lost the cost of the checks anyway! Thanks for the lesson PNC! I'll do more homework in the future!"
860,1118,PNC Bank,Current customers this bank is horrible and not competent. I cant pay my car payment from my bank account anymore because th bank said the money was not there when it clearly was and showed it in my account. I have money in my bank account it will not let you pay bills if its over a certain amont with out me calling them even hough th money is in my account its my money i should not have to call them to pay my bills with my money. This bank is the worst bank i have ever had go to a different bank not this one.
861,1118,PNC Bank,"I have taken hours out of my day to dispute overdraft fees by this bank over the past 4 months.  I have received 19, totaling $684.  Over the past 12 months , I have been through challenging situations involving my dad bei g in the hospital for over 100 days and having to take off work.  I received relief for overdraft fees for $200 last year, but the problem is that they  routinely charge multiple overdraft fees for each item that has been charged on my account.  There is no call back or I treat in helping people who are encountering financial hardship and they could care less what the reasons are.  I don’t think this bank is headed in a good direction for anyone.  I would not recommend putting your hard earned money in this bank.  I will be using another bank."
862,1118,PNC Bank,"I got a charge for auto renewal of checks and charged $27.00 plus. Since they want online banking service only, I contacted by my app  email their call center. They said go to your local office...since I work and do everything online.. I bantered online, what should I they made the mistake. All in all, they gave me Harland Clarkes phone number to dispute. Really their error! Wound up physically going to a brand to dispute and the CA had me there for Over an hour an 1/2 hour to fix.  You want online banking, but your call ctr cannot help over an error on your part. Really!"
863,1118,PNC Bank,PNC Bank is a quality institution that makes you feel like you're more than the number they treat you like family.Their Brokerage Department in my opinion is one of their best.They're innovative product line leaves you wanting for nothing.
864,1118,PNC Bank,I had a returned check so they canceled my account without my acknowledgement. Now they are holding my remaining money hostage in the account for a couple weeks until a hold is lifted. Had about $400 left in the account and have no access to my own damn money. Completely unacceptable!!!!
865,1118,PNC Bank,Pnc failed to follow through with a balance transfer from my business account to my personal account at Capital One. PNC charged me for a stop payment on the balance transfer because they sent it to the wrong address. It took PNC 10 days to stop the payment. After being passed to several representatives I finally closed my account. That whole process took 6 weeks. I strongly suggest a different bank!
866,1118,PNC Bank,"If an associate doesn't know how to fulfill a request, DON'T BLUFF!  DON'T google/look up an answer in front of a very strong (account-wise) client!  Bank:  TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE TO BE CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDERS!  and how to proof read!  OMG. Went to three branches today for a simple ask, got three sets of bumbling fools and mistakes."
867,1118,PNC Bank,"I went into a branch to setup a savings account. The bankers move slow, she did not send me a atm card like promised. I had to call the 1800 number to find out whats taking my card so long lady on the phone told me the banker never put in a card order so i had to wait 2 weeks before I received a atm card, now the pin I set up at the bank doesn't work so I call 1800 number again but they tell me only thing they can do is request a pin resend in the mail that's going to take 7 days.... this bank is a joke and I will be going to close the account if I could give zero starts I would"
868,1118,PNC Bank,"Unfortunately, there isn’t an option for leaving a zero-star review! This bank is the worst. The bank refused to pay for the $130,000.00 loss and they don't care one but how they have ruined my personal life and my retirement money.They ignored my request for a refund and then imposed an indefinite ban on my account. I got all they took back through.Aberdeen dyce Lpwhich i eventually received what was due to me."
869,1118,PNC Bank,"Honestly, since the moment I had no choice to have them since they merged with BBVA Compass, they have been a complete nightmare. Sure, I could change banks but let’s be honest, that’s a pain in the butt! I was recently a victim of fraud and absolutely livid that PNC couldn’t catch on that charges were made in AZ and then immediately in TX. BBVA would have and did when I was a victim of fraud with them. So I can PNC and was quickly told there is nothing I can do until it moves from pending to posted. I’m trying to avoid it posting because they weren’t my charges. So I took it upon myself to call these retailers and two out of the 3 of them took the charges off. So 5 out of the 6 charges gone! Great! However, this last one has been pending for a week and still can’t do anything. Oh and on top of that they charged me $7.50 for a card replacement as if I lost my card! So much for valuing their customers. This is pretty typical of big corporations and it’s really sad. Get it together PNC!!!"
870,1118,PNC Bank,If I could leave a ZERO review I would. Abysmal customer service. Longtime wait times on service calls. Poor in-bank support. Local facilities closing so now it is difficult to find human customer service. All automated and no human service efforts that may reflect care of a longtime customer.
871,1118,PNC Bank,"Absolutely TERRIBLE.  I made a simple refund from a well established department store.  Two days pass and PNC has yet to release my funds from PENDING status. Mind you, this is a simple return and the THIRD time my OWN money has been held hostage with this bank.  I will never do business with this bank again and I will insure every one I talk to knows how PNC will hold your money, blame the merchant then begrudgingly fess up to the fact it's actually their fault after you've called them four times."
872,1118,PNC Bank,"1PNC Bank is a large bank with a national presence. It offers a wide range of banking products and services, including checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, credit cards, loans, and investment services.PNC Bank's interest rates are generally competitive, but they may not be the highest in the market. For example, its standard savings account has an APY of 0.03%, which is lower than some other banks. However, PNC Bank does offer a high-yield savings account in some states, which has an APY of 2.00%.PNC Bank's customer service is generally good. The bank has a 24/7 customer service line and a network of branches across the country. However, so"
873,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC has continued to decline in service to customers. I have been a customer since the Central Bank days for personal and business. I had my last bad experience yesterday. Understaffed, closed branches, I’m not taking it anymore. Going today to open an account at another bank."
874,1118,PNC Bank,"I recently had the pleasure of working with this financial service company and honestly I had high hope cause the former company I used ripped and I had to stop using it coming here was worst for my financial needs wasn’t meet at all instead I got ripped massively and I must say, their service was highly spoken for and my expectations was to be profound instead I got scammed of £8700 on here , I had to write to ᴬˢˢᴱᵀᴿᴱᵀᴿᴵᴱᵛᴬᴸ.ᴵᴼ From the moment I walked i relayed my issues to them they took it up immediately and in less than few weeks I got a total refund of my complete money back  they rendered professional, and extremely knowledgeable services and what I lost here was recovered ."
875,1118,PNC Bank,"In-person locations went from good to absolutely awful very quickly. Attempts to go from an in-person bank to all online have failed on both fronts. When going into a branch, they can provide you with neither service nor money. I also bank with Capital One, and while there is no physical presence, their customer service and online resources are out of this world. PNC has both terrible customer service and constant online issues. What kept me there was stellar in-person service. With that dead, I am leaving. PNC is not going to survive if they keep on this trajectory."
876,1118,PNC Bank,"Had a fixed term investment that didn't perform. Then when it matured they didn't even bother to contact me, they put the funds in a non interest bearing account. When I tried to transfer my funds out of their bank they were full of double talk. Good luck if you ever deal with them."
877,1118,PNC Bank,"Since Oct 2022 trying to access PNC online has become a nightmare!  ""Oh yes, we are aware of the problems; we are working on it ... do you have  security on your system? ... disable it and see if that helps ... use another browser ... try uninstalling and reinstalling the mobile app ... the call center is now closed""  It seems like PNC is competing with itself for offering the worst online banking service -- and is winning, hands down!! Good bye PNC!"
878,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been using many different credit cards for several decades. I pay my CC statements off in full and on time every month. The exceptions are when CC statements get lost in the mail and I don't catch it, which I almost always do because I keep a bill paying chart. I paid PNC credit card statement balance in full by phone on the due date with the automated system and it said my payment was accepted and on time. They still charged a late fee and refused to wave it. Mind you I have been a PNC bank customer for decades and had my PNC CC for over 6 years making payments on time and in full as described above. When an oops happens with any other CC they are happy to wave the fee because ""I am a valued customer"". But not PNC. They said the due date was 6pm on the due date for automated system phone payments (something no other credit card does), but midnight for online payments. I made my payment at 7pm with the automated system, which told me my payment was processed and on time. But even the mangers at PNC CC services refused to wave the late fee for a payment made on time. They clearly don't value their good customers. Expect lots of empty lip service about how they value your business but actions indicating they really don't. Needless to say I cancelled my PNC credit card after the conversation with managers today, and will take all my money out of PNC bank once I have made other arrangements. The bank has been pulling all its benefits, and adding lots of fees. I haven't had to pay any fees yet but they aren't paying me enough for my money in their bank and it is clear management there no longer values its customers either. No other CC that I have ever had treated its customers with such disrespect."
879,1118,PNC Bank,"They are an ok bank as long nothing ever goes wrong.  However, any good business is best known for it's reactions when there is an issue.  PNC bank scores very low then!  We have had several problems with their staff assisting us to set up autopaymnets for credit cards and then having problems with them working.  We get charged one of the highest late payment fees in banking!  Even when their staff can see that it was an issue with them - they have a policy to waive only one fee be year regardless of what or who is to blame.  I don't trust them any more.  They are not a bank I'd recommend."
880,1118,PNC Bank,"Went to cash a small check under $40 at the branch on Sawmill Parkway and Powell road. Put in my DRL with the check at drive-thru.  Lady supposedly named Alisar came on screen and said she needed 2 forms of ID since she didn't know me. Told her I have never been asked for more than a DRL and have been coming to this branch over 5 years! Asked for a supervisor and a guy came on screen and just repeated the same line.  Asked for regional mgr and man sent out business card with branch manager's name and number. Called immediately and was then told he was on vacation that day but would  be  back next day, how convenient. No call back from branch manager.  Disgraceful customer service and asking for more than a DRL because this employee did not know me, what a joke. Shopping for  a new bank now. PNC has also closed over 200  branches this year as another former customer mentioned. Guess they have been driving away so many long term customers that they don't need many branches now. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLOWN SHOW BANK!"
881,1118,PNC Bank,"I am a 10 year client from PNC. We fell victim to a scam which we caught and brought to their attention. We spoke to approx 10 different people, filled out a police report, etc. Their response was to close all of our accounts with no notice or communication. Our sons rent bounced and we were stuck. We went to them and they royally f’d us. Never again. I will tell everyone I know to never ever use PNC."
882,1118,PNC Bank,"I have to say that PNC were excellent for me recently. I dealt with Adam Liebross for our purchase in Los Angeles and he managed to find me a rate that was not available publicly. Even with rates this high, he was able to find a special rate just below 4%. Give Adam a call, he’s very good - 8184303046."
883,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC BANK has the worst customer service of any bank I have ever encountered.They allowed someone to steal $130,000.00 fromm bank account and law enforcement tracked down the two individuals that committed the crimes and bank eve had video of one person at the PNC Bank ATM.Yet PNC Bank refused to pay  for the $130,000.00 loss and then offered $2500.00 and legal fees to cover the $130,000.00 loss and they don't care one but how they have ruined this person's life and his retirement.Totally unbelievable  they could do this to a client.Please look at their website as there are plenty of lawsuits against PNC Bank for rhis same problem and all these clients should be made well with the losses incurred at PNC Bank.They just don't care and the have insurance to cover this but they just don't want to protect their customers.  Please help bring PNC Bank to justice and be very cautious about any funds you have with PNC BANK."
884,1118,PNC Bank,I have the wallet account with 24 hour overdraft bs protection.  Which it is. I don’t keep much money in that account.  When a bill comes in i Zelle or transfer it to cover that withdraw.  Well all is fine most of the time but every now and then they return the charge or withdraw claiming I chose or to be not paid. And it always on my mortgage or another banks debt.  The money s there I. The account shows it was taken out of my account t them 2 days they they reverse it causing my payment to be late. I believe they do this on purpose the money is in the account ever time. I’m getting ready to contact my states attorney general and banking commissioner the good that will do but at least their is a record of it.  Hopefully their will be a class action lawsuit
885,1118,PNC Bank,"Unfortunately, there isn’t an option for leaving a zero-star review!  This bank is the worst. After completing a wire transfer from my account to purchase a home in a different state, I went in to have the second wire transfer done and they refused. My only option was a certified check which I had to overnight the check and wait for it to clear. After the second transaction I received a letter stating they were closing my account in roughly 25 days. I pay all my bills online through the bank or my credit card. I was treated extremely rudely by the branch who refused to return two phone calls to me. In the meantime, I was closing out a large investment account and asked to have the funds wired into another account under my name. Two days went by, and I saw no movement in my account. Luckily, I phoned the bank’s wire transfer department and was told that they couldn’t see the transfer and believed it had not been initiated. At the same time, after removing my auto pay accounts except for two that were due immediately, I saw online they had not paid one of the auto pays. Another trip to the branch since they wouldn’t return my phone call. I ended up taking a certified check for the whole amount of my account.And now, I am receiving below balance notices on my email.This bank is the worst!"
886,1118,PNC Bank,"Thia company is pathetic for a multi billion corporation. Horrible UI/UX on their website and app, can't request a debit card without going to a sketchy phone number, and cant freeze bank account either. Also charge me $7 a month if the average of my bank account isnt $500. Avoid like the plague."
887,1118,PNC Bank,"They are closing branches and when you go, the person you need is not available. You call for an appointment and no one answers the phone"
888,1118,PNC Bank,Whenever you switch to a new job getting your direct deposit in a timely manner on the 1st deposit takes forever. My past two companies every new employee I speak with gets the direct deposit on Thursday. It takes PNC until the following week to have it go through. It's moronic and it's a deposit so to use risk as an excuse is a complete joke
889,1118,PNC Bank,"HORRIBLE customer service at the South Lyon, MI branch.  I had a simple problem with my account and he was just rude  I called Wixom, MI branch and Robert was wonderful!  Helped me quickly with what I needed"
890,1118,PNC Bank,"They sent account info to prior address after 6 years at new residence and sent statement to old residence 3 months in a row.  Not impressed...  Anyone up for a class action lawsuit, I'm game...."
891,1118,PNC Bank,I should have followed my bankers warning when they whispered for me to “put my money in my mattress!”Some how I have gone through 50k in 4 months! When I buy an expensive item about a month later the transaction date changes and same money is taken out again! Then I go to look at original transaction date and it has totally disappeared! Whoever has access to change dates in PNC system is obviously allegedly embezzling money!!!! It has been happening every since PNC merged with that other bank.
892,1118,PNC Bank,EVERY GODDAMN BRANCH IN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA THAT I GO TO IS SO DAMN RUDE!!! THEY ALL SEEM LIKE THEY DON'T WANNA SERVE YOU AND EVERY ONE OF THEM CAN BARELY SPEAK UP! I AM ASKING TO PUT MY SON IN AS AN AUTHORIZED USER ON MY CARD AND I TOLD THEM BEFORE HAND HE WAS 17. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WANNA WASTE YOUR TIME IN LINE THEN TELL ME AND MY SON HE CANT BE AN USER BECAUSE HE IS NOT 18???
893,1118,PNC Bank,"Dad died, I am Estate Executor, including the house mortgage. The 1st dude I spoke to could barely slur words &I had to give him options, which seemed to take the brother latently 60seconds to respond.Now I have made 10 calls, all I wish to do is make a payment &enter my name- all the docs they have received. Now they would like me to go online and look through 3,000 something forms, do a lot of downloads & 'no, we don't send it to you.'I guess I was most taken w/ banal customer service. I am mostly taken w/ how little facilitation they are required to do. I guess I am paying off the remainder and getting the he ll out- god willing when I can communicate /w them.Funny thing is, I actually expected to find some branch or rep in Seattle, oh no, this is like a financial, plastic Supermax in the way prisons are."
894,1118,PNC Bank,"I am trying to access my account online. Entered a username and a password, then answered all the security questions, once I completed all that I get a message saying the user name is already taken. What about letting me know the username is taken before I select all the security questions? Then, I tried to log in and it did not recognize my username and password and then it locked me out of the account before I even logged in once. Really?"
895,1118,PNC Bank,I have lost thousands of dollars with PNC. I have been fighting this for years with the same results.  Their fraud department is a JOKE. Trying to get the money back has been impossible.  But the fact that my PNC account was hacked means that the fraud department was not doing their jobs.  They do not have the customers best interest. In other words PNC bank is THEIVES. The bank will steal your money.  Run away to save your money.
896,1118,PNC Bank,Had 3 transactions on my online checking that were pending and would overdraw the account. Made a deposit 2 different days to cover the overdraft and then had a surplus in the account since the pending payments disappeared from the account.  Made a purchase and suddenly the disappeared pending payment posted and overdrew the account once again. Their online banking is impossible to follow and magically posts things to cause overdraft fees. Fed up with this bank cannot wait to get away from them!!
897,1118,PNC Bank,"They have the worst online service, continually fails to recognize my information. It even stated my account number was not correct multiple times. They make paying off your loan a headache, I would have chosen a different bank to finance my car through if I could have. I bank with Chase which is light years above the inept service PNC offers."
898,1118,PNC Bank,"Ann Arbor, Michigan - Absolutely pathetic noone wants to work anymore.  I am tired of the excuses we are understaffed. We had an account and we just had to add another to an existing one.  We were told that we had to set up an appointment online if we wanted to be helped. NO walk in service.  I am closing ALL of our accounts and moving to a credit union."
899,1118,PNC Bank,"Submitted papers fir the hardship.Pnc kept on insisted the invoice I got from official email for my kid camp expense wasn't sufficient. They said should be pdf from camp place which they don't do pdf, but official email invoice.And that was the reason refuses the payment modification.This place is a joke. Stay away. They will do whatever to say no to you when you need them."
900,1118,PNC Bank,Horrible the call you up not only when you miss a payment but also to sell you all the products. Constantly harassing you every other week. Exorbitant interest rates on all their products. Stay away.
901,1118,PNC Bank,I have recently added to my elderly moms account. I have been trying over a month to enroll in mobile banking with no luck.  Their system is broken.  It has been one thing after another. I have taken of work called and do not have any more time to dedicate to PNC.  We are making a change and a ton who reads this should follow suit
902,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bank Monroe, NJ is worse than bad!! Minus customer service!! Had to change my account because of fraudulent activity. Got my new card. Customer service unable to activate it, returned it to be to try!! UI was unable to activate it AND NO ONE WOULD HELP!!"
903,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could leave zero I would. The bank manager in Asheville NC, Sara Heath, had an affair with her male client. She met this client at her work and she is married. Also, the male she had an affair with was in a long term relationship. Many people were negatively affected by her poorJudgement of sleeping with her clients. This should not be tolerated. On her business card she has written she is a woman’s business advocate. Her actions is not being an advocate for women."
904,1118,PNC Bank,"This is the WORST bank for loans. They have a very OUTDATED system (doesn’t show current pending payments so that can easily mess you up thinking it’s NOT paid when in fact, it’s just pending AND they MAIL back refunds instead of doing it ELECTRONICALLY just like they RECEIVED it as if this is 1985!!) Then the agents are not HELPFUL at ALL, so that doesn’t make you feel HEARD as a customer. Absolutely the WORST bank around!! I will be glad to be done with them very soon! I would recommend the crackhead in the basement of the bodega in the ghetto for a loan before recommending THIS bank to anyone!!! 💯"
905,1118,PNC Bank,"My wife and I had other dealings with PNC Bank so we decided to get a personal loan with them, mistake! From the beginning  nothing but mistakes made by PNC what was supposed to be a 48 hour process became 10 days. In ompetent people they give you erroneous  information  about interest rates then in the end the rates are way above what you had been told. We even lowered the amount of the loan and the rate didn't come down it went up! Less risk ,less exposure means better rate. When I questioned them I was told that they did not have any answers for me as they use a proprietary  method to come up with these rates . They use algorithms  on a computer and won't discuss the outcome with you. And when you ask to speak to a supervisor either they have all gone home or not available.  Non existent customer service  and mistake after mistake with no answers . Never again will we attempt to do business with this institution."
906,1118,PNC Bank,"I am writing this review to share my incredibly distressing experience with PNC Bank, an institution that betrayed my trust and left me in a state of financial turmoil. Falling victim to their deceitful practices was a devastating blow that I would never wish upon anyone.PNC Bank, a name associated with credibility, proved to be anything but trustworthy. Their false promises and unethical actions led to a significant loss of my hard-earned money. When I attempted to rectify the situation by contacting them, I was met with indifference and evasion.The lack of accountability and transparency from PNC Bank was nothing short of heartbreaking. They took advantage of my financial vulnerability and left me feeling helpless and disillusioned.In the midst of my despair, I discovered Kerose Limited. Their reputation for aiding victims of scams, even from well-established institutions like PNC Bank, gave me a glimmer of hope. Kerose Limited stepped in with a commitment to right the wrongs I had endured.Kerose Limited's involvement was a turning point. Their expertise, professionalism, and unwavering dedication led to the successful recovery of my stolen funds from PNC Bank. They guided me through the process, offered support, and ultimately helped me regain control over my finances.While PNC Bank's actions left me devastated and financially wounded, Kerose Limited provided a lifeline in my time of need. If you find yourself ensnared by a situation like mine, I strongly recommend seeking help from Kerose Limited. Their dedication to justice and recovery is a testament to their unwavering commitment to helping victims like me restore their financial well-being."
907,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC Bank Branch 230 E W.T. Harris Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28262 is a terrible branch.  Beware of becoming a PNC Bank customer.  The bank does not perform Know Your Customer and/or customer audits of irregular account activity if you are an online customer. BEWARE"
908,1118,PNC Bank,Three times this year went to use my debit card and all 4 were closed by the bank they reissued same thing again customer service sucks no live people to speak to have closed all branches around d my area.sent let trying to charge monthly fee called them up now they are closing my accounts and nobody can tell you anything they read of a piece of paper

Say what !!!Omg are u talking about you know what prove that one u f ing liers  same crime tactics as US bank huge fraud total scam liers trying to snatch people’s homes saying u dint pay when u did
910,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC setup my HELOC at close and set it up different than my previous 12 years of banking accounts. The way they set it up caused fees because the HELOC account had statements turned on. After I called and asked how to fix it, PNC showed me how to modify the setting but refused to refund the fees. PNC lost my business account business because of all of the “nickel and dime” fees and now they are doing the same to me for my HELOC. This bank is a joke. This is the only loan they have of mine because the bank came with the house deal. I won’t choose to do business with PNC again."
911,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC is a joke customer service stinks, the hidden fees are ridiculous,and don't understand why transactions stay pending for 6 plus days. Feed up"
912,1118,PNC Bank,Horrible bank wouldn't give back a hold for $500 notified PNC asked for my money back multiple times and each time denied. Filed complaints with 2 government agencies they still denied me my $ back. Contacted the business once again via social media and next day was granted all of my $ back.Now asked for a payment to be reversed for credit card..asked online nothing happened and no record at all. Had to make 3 calls in order to get someone to help me and no confirmation number at all. Said it would be emailed. Besides that it will take 10 business days.
913,1118,PNC Bank,"I've been a customer for several years. Had 2 personal loans with them. Within the last year, customer service has gone downhill. I've sat in the drive through with a simple, uncomplicated deposit for a good 10 minutes with no acknowledgement. And I was the only customer. Same as inside. They will leave you standing there, not even looking up, while they chat. Seems as though you're more an inconvenience than a customer. Check your attitude. If not for customers, you wouldn't have this cushy bankers hours position."
914,1118,PNC Bank,"Customer service is a major problem for this company. They added a flood insurance policy to my account because they said that I did not have flood insurance.   When I tried to prove that I did, they were rude and were unable to rectify the problem.  This bank is not trustworthy.  They do not do what is right (or honest) for there customers."
915,1118,PNC Bank,"Someone very clearly hacked my account and make a purchase. I made a claim of u authorized use of my account and it came back as denied two seconds after submitting it. What the actual F@$! I'm stuck with a charge I didn't make because PNC security is so poor?! Never EVER using this service again I don't recommend it one bit. They invite give hackers your information and don't let their protection policy fool you, they don't actually review cases Good thing I reported them to an online agency who helped me in getting back my account and money but I intend to close it for good."
916,1118,PNC Bank,"I should have known they were incompetent when it took almost two hours to open an account, but did it anyway. Today, I needed some cash in certain denominations for a special occasion. Checked the PNC website and it said they were open on Saturdays until 2pm. Arrived at 1:01pm and the doors were not locked but once I was inside, I was told they close at 1pm now. Asked about the times listed on the website and some goon stated “it’s changed now.”  Told them I just needed to exchange a large bill for small bills and was told no, we’re closed. Then update your website and lock your door, idiot!"
917,1118,PNC Bank,"Online banking is not possible. The automated options do not take me anywhere relevant. When I finally got a living person, I couldn't understand most of what they said. When I asked a question, they kept repeating the same answer without answering the question."
918,1118,PNC Bank,I had a mortgage with them and all of the sudden they doubled my monthly payment!  They forced me into escrow even though I was making insurance and tax payments separately.  They decided to force their insurance on me which was the highest available of course.  While in the process of refinancing with them I got a foreclosure letter out of the blue!  I lost my house and truly HATE them.
919,1118,PNC Bank,"I opened an account because I needed a new one and wanted a HYSA. I don't live anywhere near a physical location and didn't think that would be a problem. Oh boy, is it apparently a problem. The first card, I didn't activate right, since I forgot if I set up a PIN or not. I never received the mail with the PIN, for that one or the 2nd card I had sent to me. It's been like 2 months of this! I am lucky to have had the card activated, but I can only use it as long as I don't need a PIN. So, only rarely. I'm on a 30 min hold trying to talk to a manager, which I had to end because I got another call. I'm sure their response would have also been, ""We will send you a new one and it should get to you in 3-7 business days =D"" ... for, like, the 5th or 6th time. I'm going to cancel the whole account, because this is completely ridiculous for a large company."
920,1118,PNC Bank,"given a hard time banking during Crimea conflict, and now again, during the Ukrainian war. Shame on you, PNC!"
921,1118,PNC Bank,"Attempting to settle my deceased mother’s finances, I went to Florida Statutes for small estates, filled out and got notarized the correct affidavit and was told it was not sufficient — but they wouldn’t tell me what was lacking and said I should contact my lawyer.  For a $600 balance I am not willing to pay a lawyer $270/hr.  Meanwhile they are charging a hefty “service charge” (seriously?) each month.  By the time I extract my mother’s money from their jaws there will be nothing left to distribute to her heirs."
922,1118,PNC Bank,We have a low interest loan from car dealership with them. We have automatic draft and they keep kicking it and then sending us late notice. We have added it 3 times. The poor account folks are like robots- can figure anything out. Worst bank ever.
923,1118,PNC Bank,"My bank account was compromised. I have been waiting over 7 days for the bank to release the money that was taken out of my account illegally. I have made three trips to a branch, the manager is never there, and you cannot get anyone on the phone to help you."
924,1118,PNC Bank,"Stopped at a local branch for a medallion stamp for some stock that my mother had when she passed. Was told to allow 5 days for review. That was on June 9th. It is now June 28th. Have emailed and called the bank, numerous times. Was told in a voicemail they needed something else, but can't imagine what else they could possibly need. They have everything I have, and my mother is deceased. Branch manager, Michela, who apparently is the only one that can issue a medallion stamp, keeps passing it on to a new employee, who I can never reach on the phone. VERY disappointed in PNC Bank, and will never choose to bank at this branch again once I am done with this transaction!"
925,1118,PNC Bank,To recover a password online is a nightmare. Why not adopt what most reputable banks do to protect identity and security? Ridiculous. Total lack of consideration for the client's time!
926,1118,PNC Bank,"I would give PNC bank 0 stars if possible.  They are absolutely horrible.  They make mistakes and take months to fix them. In my case they had an error in the date of a trust account for my deceased mother. They insisted multiple times that I needed to furnish the ""updated"" document.  When we insisted that no such document existed, they said ""that's your problem not ours"".  3+ months later, and 4 escalations, they agree it was an error on their part.  From talking to a local lawyer, this is a systematic problem (intentional?) with this bank.  STAY AWAY"
927,1118,PNC Bank,"I'm not sure why I pay a service fee for this bank. Few times a week online banking is unavailable for ""maintenance"". Is my fee going to your maintenance?- because nothing changes on my end so I'm not sure what you are doing with it. My available balance all the time goes from what I actual have in my account to me miraculously having more money. Then the next business day it reflects it back to normal, and if you spent what was available you would be hit with a negative balance. And then possibly a fee.I used to promote this bank to my friends and family, but now its getting ridiculous."
928,1118,PNC Bank,"Wow, what a strange bank.  I got a car  loan through my auto dealer and had never done business with them. Their website is very poorly designed and then, heaven forbid, I missed one payment.  I found this out and promptly paid it, but then received a letter in the mail dated  the day after I made the payment and the title was ""NOTICE OF RIGHT TO CURE AND INTENT TO REPOSSERSS"".  Their caps not mine. Obviously, they put the letter in process several days before but there was nothing in the letter saying ""if you have already made this payment, please disregard"".  The letter was very, very negative and makes me think they must have a lot of bad loans.  I called to see if I should disregard the letter and got two very snarky reps.  What a terrible experience  If you are thinking about an auto loan with this bank, please reconsider."
929,1118,PNC Bank,Horrible. They took over my mortgage and then failed to pay my escrow to my homeowners insurance and didn't contact me about any issues with it.  My insurance then lapsed due to non payment and then they had the nerve to charge me insurance for the week that it had lapsed due to THEIR non payment. PNC bank can collectively jump off the tallest building they own.
930,1118,PNC Bank,In over 50 years of banking this place is by far the worst. They are primarily an on-line bank but with a horrible website that often does not work properly. Their 1-800 customer service reps are ill informed and often contradict each other and  they always insist on your full social security number as the primary way to verify an account. Furthermore they make accounting errors . Pulled $1000 out of my account without my permission because they said it was an ACH transaction from one of my other bank accounts. You cannot do that without the account holders permission and my other bank had no record of such a transfer. Once i reported them to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau I got my money back. Promptly closed the account.
931,1118,PNC Bank,Really bad service from the credit department. They are so rude and impatient! Neve choose this bank again
932,1118,PNC Bank,"Due to Bankrate.com rating, I eagerly opened an online high yield savings account with PNC.  Went through the whole process entering all my personal info.Then I logged on to designate my beneficiary, since it didn't ask during the setup.Unlike other online banks, which have a page dedicated to doing this, there was nothing available on the PNC site.So, I called customer service and was informed that I had to visit a bank branch to file paperwork to assign a beneficiary.THE ONLY BRANCH is 1.5 hrs away!!!   Ridiculous!No more opening online accounts before learning the POD or TOD  issues!They should have a disclaimer, or improve their website to allow for such standard documentation."
933,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC has lied to me about getting a hone equity loan,say denied due to Experian credit report bad, excellent credit score, 720, but I an over that.  I am getting an inheritance but have to wait 6months probate, just wanted to get rid of sone high interest rate credit cards then pay off after money from inheritance. I have had PNC checking for 37 years, but will be discontinuing any service with them soon.  I want to warn people, this bank does not care about long term customers and they lie about your credit."
934,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC slashed my credit line overnight apparently because I had paid most of it off using a balance transfer and was overpaying my minimum amounts due so that I could zero out the balance. One of the reasons they gave on the letter was that I have ""an insufficient deposit relationship"" with the bank. What is a ""deposit relationship""? That sounds ridiculous. I have a checking account and a business account. I am going to pay off the rest of the credit card balance and close all three accounts so that won't have any ""relationship"" at all with this bank."
935,1118,PNC Bank,"Unsure where to start. Worst bank by leaps and bounds.  They charge you to cash a check, never answer the phone, and if you need online assistance?!...i was asked ""is there someone around you who is tech savvy???"". Ummm, I'm 48 and intelligent and tech savvy, was following all directions the PNC site wasn't working. I could go on, I would absolutely recommend Wells Fargo.  They are efficient, non-badgering, and pleasant to work with."
936,1118,PNC Bank,"this is like one of those jobs that you apply for without looking at the reviews, and they turnedmy application away so quickly that there was no way they were able to even consider me as a possibility and now looking at the reviews it all makes sense. God always has a plan."
937,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC, is a rip off.  I financed a car loan with them, and I chose to pay off the loan, two weeks later and was charged a$144.00 extra.  Even tho I was emailed a payoff amount, when I went into pay that amount the extra money was added, saying that was the DAILY INTEREST AMOUNT ADDED.  I’ve advised all my family members and friends to close their account with them.  I hope they close down."
938,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bank is garbage. Horrible customer service, rude . For no reason whatsoever they decided to close the account and no explanations why. Hidden service fees and the worst of all banks online app. Not functional and a lot of errors. Funds deposited always late, takes a few days for money to become available. Stay away from PNC!!!"
939,1118,PNC Bank,"I deposit funds , cash and checks for a local business, Some days I may have 5 different deposits , same account no.  The teller counts the cash , then runs it in the machine to verify and then counts the coins and logs them in and then once verified , I stand there and wait for her to separate the bill denominations and then puts in her cash drawer and then puts her coins in the appropriated coin slots.  This is so time wasteful , she should do this process when there's no one standing in line waiting.  ugh"
940,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC Bank is easily tied for first place with Wells Fargo for being the worst bank ever.  Exorbitant fees, not user friendly website or account access...... horrible experience!"
941,1118,PNC Bank,"Predatory and awful. Their website is terrible. They bought my mortgage. I tried to make an extra $200 payment towards principal. They double charged my mortgage and added 200. When I called they said they had to ""request my money back"" and that I would gave to wait for a check in the mail for their mistake. GENUINELY AWFUL AND PREDATORY. Also, after stealing my extra mortgage payment and me calling they said that taking an extra 200/month wasn't doable unless I filled out a few forms (didnt tell me prior to taking my money out)."
942,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could give you a zero, I would. After 7 years plus of banking with you I am done. Your customer service is the worst in industry. Your availability to settle issue within my account show exactly who you are in this industry.  I should have dumped you with the first financial compromise but I enjoyed going into my branch and speaking with the individuals assisting me in a brick and morter. Disgusted and done with PNC- don't join this bank!"
943,1118,PNC Bank,"Went to my online access accounts, like I do 2-4 times a day and today    VVV""Your PNC Online, Mobile and Voice Banking access has been suspended.''''Here's what happened:     Your PNC Online, Mobile and Voice Banking access for user ID ending in ********* has been suspended because your user ID and/or password were entered incorrectly too many times."" Before the online banking just shut down for everyone."
944,1118,PNC Bank,I will never recommend this bank to anyone ever again. They placed a 30 day hold on a Wells Fargo check for only $1000 I was originally told 5 days. Federal regulations say 7.  The person who placed the hold is never available. I want to close my accounts but now I’m held hostage by this excessive. The customer relations in Pittsburgh is trash. After seeing all of these reviews had I known they were such a crappy bank I never would’ve opened an account
945,1118,PNC Bank,This bank is horrible.   If you ever need any help with any issue GOOD LUCK.   Calling the number get ready for non-English person who won’t be able to fix a problem & takes forever to wait for a supervisor.
946,1118,PNC Bank,"Tried to pay an online invoice from a well-known electronics store. Business credit card was decline by the fraud department.  Took four phone calls to different PNC numbers and I was still transferred multiple times per call.  The 12th person I talked to finally knew what to do.  Not the first time this has happened. Training? Competency? Knowledge? Apparently, all are victims of budget cuts. They really don't know just how bad they really are."
947,1118,PNC Bank,"We are extremely disappointed with PNC bank. We were recently hacked. The bank did not close. Our debit card got hacked three more times the very next day and now they are not giving our money back. We have to wait 10 days at least until they are done reviewing we’ve spoken to probably five different people and they are not helping so we will be closing our accounts as soon as this is wrapped up, but do not bank with PNC."
948,1118,PNC Bank,"I logged into my account while on vacation in the Bahamas, but it was immediately suspended. With the help of PlanOff, I was able to make enough money to see me through my holiday. I've returned home, and despite submitting a number of paperwork, my account has yet to be opened. My bank account is quite buoyant."
949,1118,PNC Bank,"If there is a more incompetent bank on the planet I can’t think of it.  We’ve moved three times since taking out our auto loan (loads of regrets there).  Each time we’ve called to update our address.  Guess what, they never did it.  This is a criminal enterprise that wants to do nothing more than bankrupt you!  Pay on time or not, they’ll manage to lose your payments and you’ll never know until it’s too late."
950,1118,PNC Bank,If no star's was a option I'd give them a Zero. This company will not exist in 2 year's. The service they provide is simply pathetic. I've been a long time customer. Looks like im moving to truist
951,1118,PNC Bank,"I loved my local branch, all the employees  were great.  Now Corporate, the online banking.  Horrible.  Never tell a customer that ""This is the only choice you have""  no, not true.  I made a different choice, and 30 min later closed my account.  Lots of other financial institutions out there.  Choices, I have many.  Buh Bye PNC, thanks for helping me make the correct choice."
952,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst bank ever. Merchant agreed to refund over $300. The refund never hits out account. PNC customer service states to file a dispute. In which we did over a month ago. Emailed receipt to PNC. PNC is allegedly are ""investigating"" but wont tell us which step their investigation is. No money, no provisional credit. Guess we should have learned from the time PNC weaseled out of depositing the $400 new account reward. That time we missed the deadline by two days. When we signed up that was not an issue as we were told people cant control their direct deposit dates. Time for $400 to be deposited, Yup sorry you missed it by two days. PNC just likes to mess with people's money"
953,1118,PNC Bank,"I was originally lured in on an advertised personal loan application process with a 24 hour notice of approval. After waiting 3 days, I called PNC Bank to inquire as to the status of my application. The Representative informed me that the loan approval could take up to 5-7 business days. Disappointed, I begrudgingly waited. After more than 7 business days, I contacted the bank again, where I was then informed that my application was cancelled. Upon asking why, the Rep couldn't give me a clear answer but reassured me that my application would be reinstated. I again waited 3 more days before calling PNC Bank for the 3rd time. The Rep told me my application was still being processed. I asked if there was someone I could talk to in order to clarify the status of my loan. There was no common sense answer from the Rep, almost like I was being bamboozled. After waiting a total of 12 business days, I cancelled my loan application, still with no answer to how/why it took so long to get an answer on a $2000 personal loan for a person with a 800 credit score rating. I am speechless but certain, I will never use PNC Bank for any future financial needs."
954,1118,PNC Bank,"this bank gave a credit card of $5000 ,they lowered me $3000 of  my credit line,because I forgot to pay a monthly payment for one day ,that is  not acceptable and ridiculous for a client of severals years ,I never paid late ,After this problem my credit bureau dropped 26 points. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS BANK"
955,1118,PNC Bank,"I went to their Back Bay Office to check on something with my Account.  I was asked to wait for a Teller.  She finally came out and after standing at a counter looking at her Laptop for 5 minutes, when I got up to leave she offered to help me.  Terrible Branch and there are very few in Boston. I decided not to use PNC anymore."
956,1118,PNC Bank,My family has banked with pnc since my grandfather was young. I tried to get a loan the other day and they denied me cause of a Victoria secret credit card that I got 8 years ago when I was 16-17 and thought it was a gift card. Was late 3 months on that. And recently got into a motorcycle wreck that put me out of work for months. And I accidentally went over my credit card $3.42. And they won’t let me get a loan because of this. Stingiest ducking bank out there. 75+ years my family has gone to them and that all stops today. L&N here I come
957,1118,PNC Bank,"I would have given 0 if that were an option.  Probably made 12 calls to an untrained (and consequently, incompetent) customer service center.  Not sure who JD Powers talked to get their they survey data but PNC customer service is a (bad) joke"
958,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC use to offer top customers free safe deposit boxes.  Now, someone in corporate PNC decided they don't value top customers and took this one service away.  PNC is Cheap."
959,1118,PNC Bank,I tried to set up a high interest savings account online. They emailed me to say I was declined due to security reasons whatever that meant. I called and spoke to a rep who went over all my information and could not find anything wrong.  She told me to try again which I did and it said the same thing.  I will be finding another bank to do business with
960,1118,PNC Bank,"Really disappointed in PNC. My daughter is going to BGSU next and received a scholarship and I need to deposit it and then have them write a check to BGSU instead of her. Unfortunately for us, they want to charge us to write a check and it cost $5.00. I explained I am member but they only cared about the $5.00. The sure lied to the students to get them to sign up at PNC."
961,1118,PNC Bank,"Taking over 7 days to clear a cashier's check. Their customer service cannot even tell me when it will clear. They said their investigation team has it. Perfectly good check my customer gave me. Customer service is bad both at the branch and worse on the phone. They bought my bank, never had problems before that. Will be switching"
962,1118,PNC Bank,"This bank is awful. I forgot my password and I changed my phone number and there is no way for me to get access to my bank account without a code going to my OLD phone number.  I mean 2023 and there’s no way for them to update my phone number online so I can login? He says the ONLY way we can do it is my snail mailing me a new password.  Who even does that for ONLINE banking.  I am fearful after reading reviews now, that they will be horrible with my $$.  Definitely going to refinance my balance transfers wayyyy before the 16th month so they don’t charge me interest."
963,1118,PNC Bank,"Asked for home equity line , and they turned me down without asking for documents that I could have provided if had known. If I reapply, it would be 45 more days. I’ve decided to forget it."
964,1118,PNC Bank,This bank can improve by going back to being a bank!!!Scrapping tellers and drive through and the poorest savings and CD rates out there. Now they charge for new checks even with my very large balances in both checking and money market savings (which is a joke on their interest pay out)Will be looking to leave them soon.
965,1118,PNC Bank,"opened a new credit card with 0 % interest for the first 15 months. Made a $20,000 purchase and 3 months later started getting hit with interest! over the past 18 years never had an issue like this with any other bank or credit card company."
966,1118,PNC Bank,Wanted to send them a power of attorney for my dad who has dementia. Was told I had to mail the POA to the head office in Pittsburgh. Sent certified mail so I know it was received. Three weeks later and several calls and still no processing of POA. Script reading customer service agents are useless.
967,1118,PNC Bank,"I went to get a cashier's check for my parents funeral on the Erie avenue and I street branch. 1st she did not greet me, was rude in that I had to tell her what I wanted since she did not ask me.  When she gave me the check she said nothing. Yet, she quickly greeted the man behind me. Very unprofessional, I don't want friendliness, just professional courtesy."
968,1118,PNC Bank,I received a cash back rewards notice for Tire Kingdom for both my cc & debit card which I activated because I needed 4 new tires. I checked the morning of my appointment to make sure it was activated for my visa cash back. I was supposed to get $40 for using it. I didn't receive it & when I checked the next day the bank had removed it. The activation was good through 5/15/2023. It is still available on my debit card. I think it is pretty dirty of them to reneg on this purchase. I would have used a different card where I was guaranteed cash back.
969,1118,PNC Bank,went to cash my check wanted  half  cash back and deposit  other &they make me deposit  all.. Never had any issues  until til I opened account  with this  bank.
970,1118,PNC Bank,"i have a car loan with PNC bank and have called PNC bank several times , minimun 4x to try to set up the account to make payment which starts in early June. Anytime , i call, the line goes dead, or the rep cannot figure out the loan.  i am leaving this review here so that if PNC sends me a late payment bill, this will be the witness. what kind of bank does this? i have done loans with other banks with ease. Never encountered this."
971,1118,PNC Bank,"After opening an account my experience has been terrible.  After 30 days I had to call and request, again, checks for my CHECKING account.  If I had a good alternative I would move my business.  Avoid them if possible."
972,1118,PNC Bank,It's time this bank closes it's doors. There customer service people are poorly trained and there technology stinks. Trying to close my account and no help from customer service. I was told to transfer my balance which I tried but the app said no account available to transfer from so I used zelle to move my money but now days later the app is transferring money that's not there. When the heck. Now I have to wait and send this money back because they refuse to stop an action which they are doing. Besides all this they took away the tellers from my back. Goodbye forever PNC
973,1118,PNC Bank,"My story with this bank: I am a tourist on a B1 visa. I am Syrian, we have no bank accounts back home. The international laws prohibit us from making an account. I am a physician persuing training in the US. I trained there for 4 months and went back home. While there, PNC agreed to open an account for me. They said even if you went abroad, we wouldn’t close the account. I trusted them and placed my entire networth with them, because these were savings made to support my medical residency application in the US and I needed access to an online payment platform . I have access to no other funds anywhere. Just when I needed the money, a message from my prior roommate in the US saying that they had sent mail stating that they were closing the account. Decision is final. I rush to open my PNC app just to find that there’s no way for the money out. I try on transfers, Zelle, I tried everything, they even stopped my debit card. I was not in the US to receive a check. They directed my calls to a number that didn’t have a person on it. They said I had to leave a voicemail and that no callback was guaranteed. Luckily, customer service was willing to re-open my access to the mobile banking app but of course, all activity was limited , I kept trying until I was able to send the money via PayPal account previously linked to the bank. It was very very risky since that people account was not verified by my identity and if they tried to verify my identity and found that I’m Syrian, they wouldn’t have accepted that. They would’ve kept all the money, but thank God that went smoothly. A bank that exploits an extremely unprivileged person who has a goal of improving their career, and had trusted them with all of their savings, is just evil."
974,1118,PNC Bank,"High Yield Savings application could not be approved. w tf?When I called several times they declined to answer, why? Never got regular mail with explanation. They are rude and incompetent."
975,1118,PNC Bank,"I made a simple mistake when I set up autopay for my new card in 2020.  The website seemed to be asking me for an end date with no option for ""ongoing"" so I entered a date that was two years later, thinking I would call them at some point to change it to ""forever/ongoing.""  Well, with the craziness of the pandemic for those two years, I completely forgot to find out why I had to put an end date.  My autopay ended last year and I did not realize it until a 30 day late was reported by PNC bank on my credit report.  My great credit score immediately dropped by 70+ points.  As soon as I realized what happened, I paid my account up to date and set up autopay again.  I spoke with several people at PNC and requested a goodwill removal of the 30 day late after explaining my mistake with the website autopay system, and got absolutely nowhere.      Bottom line, PNC doesn't care about its customers at all, and I would not recommend PNC products to anyone."
976,1118,PNC Bank,"We have been with PNC for 20+ years.  I initially pulled my savings and opened an account elsewhere because they had become annoying in how they handled business. Now, I am in a difficult interim, not late on bills…a previous balance transfer offer I had with PNC had been fully paid and on time.  Now, they sent me another balance transfer offer that said “pre-approved”. So I called in because could use it right now.  What do they do after I called and spent time on the phone signing up?! Flat out denied. Said some nonsense about status with Experian. I don’t buy it and don’t care. They had sent me a “pre-approved” offer, I spent my valuable time signing up, and get zero return.  This is absolutely, hands down THE worst banking company! I strongly urge others to stear clear and give your business to a bank that appreciates its customers. And follows thru on their “word”."
977,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC is trash because they send me a letter stating they were closing my account. I tried to cash app someone got declined. I was able to get gas today thank god but I call and ask why the operator was rude and told me we dont have to tell you why we are just closing your account. I go to a branch they tell me that is crazy because its nothing wrong with the account, I call the customer service again they tell me the same which is they have it in their agreement where they can “End the relationship” like that sounds crazy to me and I dont think its right now I have bills to pay as well as things to pay for out of my account now I have to go get my money from there and shop around for another bank. I have always thought highly of this bank but man was I wrong."
978,1118,PNC Bank,I chose this bank due to the fact they deposit funds into my account the next business day. Unlike other banks who hold onto those funds anywhere between 3 -7 days.
979,1118,PNC Bank,PNC is the worst bank I have ever dealt with in my 40 years of banking experience. They have hidden charges. PNC did not inform us about their charges for the services they never provided. No written or verbal information and charging monthly while other banks offer interest.It is so good to know PNC is closing down in many states. PNC is such a fraudulent bank. They don't even deserve one star!
980,1118,PNC Bank,"I went to the Destin fl branch of PNC,I normally do the drive-thru,but there was a line(4 cars-on lane open)so I opted to go inside.Enter the lobby and there were a few people ahead of me,I was fourth in line.Clearly he was the only teller on.Talk about multitasking, he was what we in the service industry  call in  the ""weeds""The only other employees  is saw were in their offices with customers.Reagan acknowledged all of us,apologized and thanked us for our patience.He was truly grace under fire,the drive thru had a temperamental guy who clearly had an attitude, Reagan took it in his stride.He handled it like a pro.i was waiting for a ""hidden camera prank show to be involved. This man was so professional and I never leave reviews,but I had togive it up to him.Reagan Hobbes is his name,and a truly great employee,and was so courteous through it all.Felt I must comment.He is to be applauded.Great job."
981,1118,PNC Bank,"These people must have terrible hiring and training programs.   I have a large mortgage with them and pay every month on- time plus an extra $1000 in principal.  I sent them a check while out of state, no coupon, with my account number handwritten in the memo field.  They cashed it and credited it to the wrong account, then started harassing me for several consecutive days afterward. I had to speak with them several times, then finally had to mail a copy of the back of my check to prove they already had the Money, ON-TIME!!They could have easily and simply matched the address on my check to my accounts when processing, BUT THEY DIDN’T.  Really DUMB mistake for a Byron a $5000 check.  Very poor quality control.  Then they could have searched for the check amount in their system- it’s a very odd, likely unique dollar amount- should have been easy to find.  I’m sure there are other ways also, but instead of utilizing those methods to find the check, they focused on emailing me and calling me on the phone.   IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE (my mortgage was sold to them), CHOOSE ANOTHER BANK/MORTGAGE company. 6.15.23"
982,1118,PNC Bank,"Unhelpful and unapologetic about the mistakes they have made. Mistakes that have cost me and could cost you money. Don't bank here, don't get a mortgage here, and do not get their credit card. The reviews speak volumes."
983,1118,PNC Bank,"I just opened an account with them a few days ago, then deposited a check the same day. I went in to pull money from the account and was told what they have on file doesn’t match the ID’s I used to open it. I provided my driver’s license, social security card, my chase bank card, my account opened on the app, and the email showing I signed up. I tried speaking with a customer service clerk through the app and she was about as useful as a box of rocks. I have money in an account that I’m honestly not sure how to access. I’m taking extra documentation tomorrow and will hopefully be closing my account. I have never been treated the way I was in any business establishment, the way PNC bank treated me. 0 out of 10, definitely do not recommend."
984,1118,PNC Bank,You can barely access a person now. It has transitioned to automated. Customer service also very unhelpful.My account was hacked. They want to charge a fee of $7.50 for a replacement card. It’s very annoying
985,1118,PNC Bank,"Despite pushy pre-approval offers to refinance existing debt, their entire process predicates upon new debt, and at no point do they actually give any consideration nor do they give any opportunity to paying off existing debt as opposed to incurring new debt, and so the process for approval is misguided and unfair. While this is unfortunate, their lack of feedback and cookie-cutter responses to everything leave much to be desired.- Generated emails without real responses- Phone personnel who don't answer questions, read off a script and then end a call- Lackluster application process"
986,1118,PNC Bank,PNC bank is garbage. rude . For no reason whatsoever they decided to close The accounts that been there for years by sending me email without even explaining making the company loose a lot . Stay away from PNC!!!
987,1118,PNC Bank,"I was given a check written on a pnc bank account. So I went to that bank to cash it. I don't have a account there, so I put my drivers license and the check into the drive thru capsule and pushed the send button. The teller told me I needed to give an additional form of id like a passport (which I don't have) or a household bill with my name on it. She said they require two forms of id and would also charge me a fee for cashing the check. I told her to send everything back and I would go to my bank to cash it. Pnc bank sucks!!! 😡🤬"
988,1118,PNC Bank,"Been with them for 30 years never had a problem I trust them and their website is excellent. I don't use them on mobile. I don't use any bank or credit card on mobile if you do that you're taking a huge risk in these days. When people can hack your phone just by walking past you PNC bank,  Is a good bank despite all of the low reviews?"
989,1118,PNC Bank,My debit card was hacked and PNC will not back me up!  The Orchards of Northwest Detroit is a scam! It all started there.  PNC can see that all the transactions were made in Detroit. I even sent PNC a spreadsheet showing that the transactions were in Detroit after I was transferred to the Orchards of Armada.
990,1118,PNC Bank,"Pnc on S elmora ave bank in elizabeth nj is the worst service ever they have one person working in here, they are so slow smh horrible service definitely never coming back here again… they should be closed down"
991,1118,PNC Bank,"Have anyone had issues with this bank . I would monitor my account by checking my balance 5 - 6 times a day ! before I went to bed on last night I checked my account again and I had a balance of 526.00 in one of my accounts . I woke up this morning and iam now 1,019 in the negative. This is like the second time this has happen . I am super pissed about this like we’re did my money go that was in my account . How did I go from 562 balance and now iam negative 1019 in the negative. Have anyone else been having these issues ."
992,1118,PNC Bank,I applied for a car lease pay off in Florida The agent had no idea what he was doing Florida you can’t pay off a lease from a bank it must be paid off from a dealer They charged me a fee plus interest on a loan I didn’t receive and the review showed I was at fault
993,1118,PNC Bank,"When i joined PNC right jere in my home town everyone was bitchin and complaining about banks steal your money, grumpy tellers, blah blah blah...look these people work just as hard if not harder to deal with all these pissed off people on a daily, which i get it, we all have jobs like that, but pnc tellers have to deal with people who are mad about their money and thats a whole different thing....so next time youe malong a deposit or withdrawaling money and the teller seems a little worse for wear, just remember, she has to deal with your punk assess also, and all frikin day, so give them a little pat on tje back and tell them thwy do a great job dealing with alot more upset people than over 60% of what we deal with on a daily...unless you are in the food/guest service industry,then when you know, you know and then how about reason with them..they need pay bills also...."
994,1118,PNC Bank,"I hate this bank so much....I literally was about to sign up to buy a car through carvana and in order to lower my downpayment I needed to link my bank account through Plaid and low and BEHOLD! Out of all the banks listed even 3rd party banks like Chime, PNC was literally the only bank greyed out!!! Literally the only bank that wont allow you to connect through Plaid. This bank account inconvinences in so many ways! Now I can not buy my car because my money is stuck in that account and I needed 3 months of bank statements to get a car. I am being forced to open a whole new bank account and wait 3 months or pay $3k more for a downpayment when if the bank wouldve connected it wouldve been just $1k down instead of $5K down. Then to top that off if you ever turn your debit card off through the mobile app and decide to go out with friends prepare to be left stranded with no money! Literally every night after 11pm you have no access to your virtual debit cards to turn off or on......I am just going to close my account. Even their customer service sucks they never pick up the phone or have direct answer. I really hate BBVA merged with them."
995,1118,PNC Bank,This bank sucks. Depositing any checks or cash takes long time because they don’t have tellers. I waited for 45 minutes.I don’t know why anyone would want to do business with this company.
996,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could fine negative stars I would I had my business account with PNC I went out of town on a business trip, first day I was there I used my card no problem. Then the second I sent to use my card and it wasn’t working logged into my account and my cards had been canceled. Called PNC and the lady was extremely rude and said I don’t have to give it a reason we have decided to sever ties with you, you can come into a branch to withdraw money or we will mail you a check in 30 days for remaining balance! I was dumbfounded and explained to her that I was out of town on a business trip in an area where there was no PNC branches she said like I said I don’t have to give you a reason or explain anything else to you, I asked for her supervisor she disconnected the call"
997,1118,PNC Bank,You charged my daughter $40 to cash her payroll check because she was not a member. written on a PNC account.And everyone in ourfamily will no longer be members
998,1118,PNC Bank,"10 minutes waiting in drive thru, 3 lanes going. when Its my turn, the lady comes on and says it will be a few minites because there are people in the lobby. wait 8 minutes, comes back on ansd says we are getting to yours. Then another lady comes on and asks what i want to do. Does not make sense. If you are working drive thru, you dont work the lobby as well. Its always like that you wait 15 minutes to get up to the machine then wait another10min if not longer  This is at tillmans corner."
999,1118,PNC Bank,"What kind of bank calls you and tells you you can refinance your loan and then denies you? Then you pay your debts down for several months and earn a 700 credit score, and they STILL denied me.Here's an idea. Run a soft inquiry before offering a loan. That way you don't offer it and then deny the guy trying to take care of business. BBVA was awesome. This company bought the branches, and I have not been happy since. This is the capstone experience of my time with them. I didn't want to bother looking for another bank due to having to change all of my accounts to this. Now I look forward to doing this right after the first of the month."
1000,1118,PNC Bank,"Their website stinks and so does their customer service.  Messages left for customer service, never a call back, and it's been months!"
1001,1118,PNC Bank,Everyone watch out this bank they cheating customers
1002,1118,PNC Bank,"I am out of the country for several months. PNC requires a phone number for PIN verification on login when their system does not recognize the browser. Even though SMS PIN verification is the least secure two-factor authentication mechanism, US banks continue to think they are keeping accounts secure.My real issue is with PNC Customer Disservice. My business account will not accept my mobile phone number because I have it associated with my personal accounts. PNC thinks I should carry multiple phones for their convenience. They have it set up instead to call my business landline, which is currently on my desk 4,200 miles away. I contacted them to find out if I can change it. They won't send email (other banks will) and they said they could have it call my international number, but could not send text messages to it. This was the first call. I was told to message the business unit to have this set up. Half an hour chat session only to be told to call the international customer disservice number again. Two more calls - both times disconnected when the rep didnt' know how to complete a call transfer. Fourth call, I get through and the rep tells me they can set it up, places me on hold for half an hour (cha ching! with international call charges) only to finally get back on the line and say that they cannot do this right now. Customer disservice complaint rep tries to call me on my land line on 7/5 and wonders why I won't answer. Sends me an email. I call today and she tells me that ""while PNC tries not to disconnect customers, it is a phone system after all..."" Yeah, and they can't wait on the line until the receiving department answers to make sure the call isn't dropped. Blaming technology is not an excuse for incompetence and customer disservice.Anyway, the result of today's call (number 5 international call) was nothing except the customer disservice rep would ""document"" my concerns. That's code for ""do absolutely nothing"" and that is exactly what PNC Bank does best.I'll be back in the US in September. My first stop is another bank. Most of the calls happened on 7/3, except the last one, which took place 7/10."
1003,1118,PNC Bank,"Went to my PNC bank in Beaumont,Tx and all the drive thru lanes are closed for good,you have to go inside to do business."
1004,1118,PNC Bank,"My husband died in mid March. He has a small IRA at PNC and I am his only beneficiary. He does not have other heirs either. I provided PNC with the death certificate TWICE. I provided them with a copy of the signed document where he assigned me the beneficiary TEN YEARS AGO. I called them several times and I went to the branch twice. I was told they needed a document assigning me the executor of the estate, they needed 11 business days to research, I should hire an attorney, go to probate, etc., etc., etc. I consulted an attorney who assured me none of these are necessary according to the law in my state. The customer service reps are rude and disrespectful. I filed a complaint with the BBB and with the FCC. So far I have received 2 pre-fab responses that they sent to everyone to the effect that they are researching my issue and I will get a response by JUNE 13. From reading other BBB complaints it appears this is standard practice for them to hold people's money for a long time and make them jump through hoops rather than being able to grieve their loved ones. Do not put your money in this bank, you may have a field day trying to get it back!"
1005,1118,PNC Bank,Don’t use them! Mobile banking app is a joke! You deposit a check with the app and they immediately put a hold on the check. Here I am a week later not able to access the funds! They are scamming people saying it was flagged for fraud. The check came from a local branch in town. I’ve verified the funds have been released from the escrow company and they say there is nothing they can do. I’m pretty sure this bank is going bankrupt! Get your money out now! I will be filing a complaint with the SEC. I’ve heard they are doing this to other customers as well. GET YOUR MONEY AND RUN!!!!! They don’t care and are SCAMMING THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!!!
1006,1118,PNC Bank,VERY BAD BANK there services are always down cant zelle cant check balance cant check past purchases if i could rate the .0001 of a star i would extremly bad bank dont recomend
1007,1118,PNC Bank,"I did an ACH transaction on 7/8/2023 for my auto insurance. I knew that the funds weren't available at the time of the transaction, but I knew I had time to have the funds available. I called PNC to verify how long it would take for the transaction to clear, since technically it's a check. I was told 3 business days, which only includes M-F. I made it very clear during the call that it was an ACH payment, and I spoke to more than one rep over the course of 2-3 days to make absolutely certain that what I was told was fact. They all verified what the first agent had told me. Well it turns out that it was not true. I also called on Monday 7/10/2023 to ask if the transaction would still be paid if all funds were not available or if it would be returned and was assured that all that would happen is that I would incur an NSF fee, which I was fine with. It turns out that was also untrue, since I woke up to an email today notifying me that there was a ""decision"" on my account that I needed to address. I logged in and saw that I had until 2pm est. time today to have the funds available, or the payment would be reversed, which would have cancelled my insurance. I do not hold PNC responsible for me not having the funds available, nor do I hold them responsible for upholding their policy. What I DO hold them responsible for is the misinformation that was spread by their representatives. It would be one thing if I was misinformed by ONE rep, but I spoke to several people who ALL misinformed me during my calls with them. I'm not sure if this is the fault of the reps, or the bank itself. The fact that more than one of their employees gave false information indicates to me that this is a widespread issue within that bank's culture and I am seriously reconsidering my relationship with them. I asked that it be escalated to have a higher up contact me about my complaint, but based on some of these other reviews I doubt that very much will change. This may explain why they have had to close so many branches just this year."
1008,1118,PNC Bank,"I've liked this bank for quite a few years, but this spring, they've failed at perhaps their most basic function, and I'm looking for a new one.Our property taxes have to be paid with a paper check. I don't use those often, but PNC started charging - a couple dollars per check! - to print them, so instead I ordered an inexpensive box from Bradford - you know, just like we did for decades before everything was online. I made sure I had ample funds in my account and gave my check to the tax collector.PNC rejected it as ""suspicious."" I called them, and they looked at it, confirmed everything was filled out correctly, the numbers were correct, everything. What could possibly be suspicious about my paying property taxes on the address printed on my check, which is also my address of record with the bank?The fact that it's a check, and not one they sold me. I wanted an assurance that they'd honor my next check when I sent another one to the tax collector, and I asked them to cover the $30 fee I incurred because of it. I didn't ask for anything else. They promised to call me back, but never did. It's been weeks now, the deadline is approaching, and I can't reach anyone at my supposedly reputable bank to confirm they'll do something as simple as honor a valid check drawn on my account. I'm out a *lot* of time going back and forth with the tax collector, an extra $30 fine plus gas, and a lot of frustration and embarrassment. The tax collector says I'm far from the only one this has happened to.And PNC clearly doesn't care a bit."
1009,1118,PNC Bank,These folks don't return calls.  Had to call several branches before I could find any help.  This has been going on for over a year.  Their medallion policy is very cruel.
1010,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC Bank in Lago Vista, Tx is great. They are always in a happy helpful mood. While not all PNC branches are fantastic, this one is."
1011,1118,PNC Bank,Worst customer service of any bank I've ever experienced. They make it extremely difficult and time consuming just to pay off a HELOC.
1012,1118,PNC Bank,I can not stand PNC. They do the bare minimum. I will not be using PNC anymore. I'll withdraw my money so I have my money. They can't hold or keep it. Have to wait just have to wait to get your money. I do not recommend.
1013,1118,PNC Bank,I used Pnc for merchant banking. I was double billed for months for equipment I returned. I asked to have my account credited and wasted so much of my time to try and get a refund. Their customer service is the worst.
1014,1118,PNC Bank,Next to IMPOSSIBLE to talk to a real person....Just one option after another
1015,1118,PNC Bank,"I originally started my bank account with BBVA, which offered me a $400 bonus for starting a Checking Account with Direct Deposit. I was going to get another $50 bonus, once I started a Savings account, within six months. I also held a BBVA Compass VISA credit card, with $2000 limit. After six months, PNC acquired BBVA and informed me my Savings account did not meet the minimum balance requirements for bonus eligibility, a policy I never knew existed. PNC instructed me to destroy my existing credit card, promising a PNC credit card would replace it. Despite me asking several times about my new credit card, I was passed off to many Customer Service representatives who knew nothing, eventually I got hung up on and the new card never arrived. I still held remaining credit on the Visa card, but was unable to continue using it because I had nothing to swipe, for new purchases. I never missed payments and yet, PNC raised my existing VISA card APR from 24.99% to a whopping 31.99%, which I find is Usurious highway robbery. When I learned PNC was shutting down certain branches I realized the BBVA takeover forced them to cut costs and I was dealing with just another nickel and dime, ruthless Commercial Bank. I was finally told I needed to pay off my remaining BBVA balance first, then re-apply for a PNC Visa credit card. However, at those outrageous interest rates - I recently closed all PNC accounts and switched to a Credit Union. The staggering amount of negative reviews is no anomaly - PNC has resorted to using deceptive practices and evasion of truth, to perpetuate its existence. BBVA was a great bank, but PNC tarnished their stellar reputation, by being the polar opposite of BBVA. My best recommendation, is run far away from PNC."
1016,1118,PNC Bank,"Wow! What a great experience. I called & got ""Monique"" and her help was outstanding!  She walked me through a change in auto payments, slowly and clearly, step-by-step, telling me just where to clear, what to enter, etc. She was among the best agents I have have had the pleasure to deal with."
1017,1118,PNC Bank,Got car loan. Dealer picked PNC without checking with me. I asked if I could pay with credit card and they said yes. Lo and behold they were only take bank accounts with routing numbers. Was told for over a year they might be do that down the road. Not very up to date bank. Try larger bank for auto loans
1018,1118,PNC Bank,"I had automatic payments set through PNC to pay my mortgage. My checking account was compromised and I called PNC so the auto payment would be handled correctly. I had to call my bank to make sure the money was in the right place for the transfer. I had conformations on both sides. This took some time on my part but I wanted to make sure it went through. PNC failed to process the payment and then wanted to charge me a late fee. While waiting for a rep to answer, they played an automated message about how they would take legal action and use any information they obtained to make sure they could get there payment. (I have never been late ever for the 8 years I have been paying on this mortgage.) I got the representative on the phone after holding over 15 min. (The wait time for them was only 2 min. I heard this recording 7 times. The rep was fine except she reminded me that any information gained would be used to collect a debt. Meanwhile she had no idea why I was even calling. I explained the entire situation and she verified everything on my account including a question about do i live there. I thought this was odd to ask a question since it none of there business. I was merely trying to to find out why they didn't do there Job in the first place. I have had a mortgage on this property since 2015. (never late on any payment) So i Told her I would just go ahead and make the payment on the phone since they cant do this on there own with the same information. WOW! so she was trying to get me to pay a late fee because the payment was not taken out of my bank like they said it would be. She said she would remove the late fee as a one time courtsey. That I could only do this one time a year. So again this is my fault because they cant train there employees. They want me to pay because they don't train their employees.I have already taken my checking and saving accounts away from them because it shouldn't cost money to have a checking account. I guess I really want every one to know the reason these guys have a 1.3 experience is because they have no understanding of taking care of the customer, which is why they are in business to start with) I would advise anyone that need a bank to go to a bank where the customer comes first. This is not the place to go, unless you like being treated an a criminal for not making a payment that they could have withdrawn when ever they wanted. I guess you can take a horse to the water but you cant make him drink. I will be removing my mortgage as soon as possible. If the corporation that set there policies with the customer in mind and understand that they are hurting them selves because they dont care.  Good luck in the future I will make a point to let everyone know how good you are to your customers. If i could leave less than one on the experience I would. They would probably think I just left it blank. btw it would be -5.0 that is 5 less than 0.     I left an explanation of my sore because I'm not sure anyone who works there can figure this out on their own."
1019,1118,PNC Bank,"AWFUL!   My mom has them and everytime we log in, it says it doesn't recognize her.   We call, change password, etc and it works once and then can't log in.    It is AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1020,1118,PNC Bank,"This bank is a joke.  Customer service has no idea what they're doing.  Called to find out if I could use my debit card to make a $2,000.00 purchase and was told yes only to find out that I needed to go to the bank to get an increase.  Next I wanted to get some foreign currency of $250.00 to find out I need to go in person and not over the phone when I have to pick it up regardless and show ID.  It takes up to 5 days to get the money.  I'm switching banks."
1021,1118,PNC Bank,This really is the worst bank in the world they have the rudest employees who treat you like it doesn’t matter what you think and top it off they make it so hard to track what’s happening to the money in your accounts I honestly feel like my money is not safe at this bank it honestly feels like someone in this institution has this bank set in a way to avoid helping customers as much as possible. HORRIBLE banking RIDICULOUS Employees I’d give it no stars if i could I cannot wait to close these accounts!
1022,1118,PNC Bank,DO NOT get a home equity line of credit through.  thois bank.  They make it almost impossible to access your money!!  SO frustrating.  Worst bank I've ever used.
1023,1118,PNC Bank,PNC app not working too often.  Their web site also kicks me out during a session.  I’ve been with PNC for decades and all of a sudden it’s a bad bank.
1024,1118,PNC Bank,"I recently set up a high yield saving account with them. I tried to transfer money from Chase over, but they immediately put a hold on the transfer and the site said I had to call them to release the hold. I called, was told it was a standard 5 day new account hold. A week later, the hold is still there saying the same thing - call them to remove it. Not looking forward to talking to them again as obviously their phone reps don't know what the hold really was.I also set up my online profile with them. Their online banking is a mess. The site looks like it was made in 1999 and has an absolutely awful customer interface. Days after I set it up, they sent me an email asking me to to set up my online profile with them. Yeah, already did that, but followed the link anyway and as expected, they said I've already set an online profile up - lol. Then I get a message from them that I need to do things on their site to setup online (paperless) statements. I had ALREADY done that, but okay I'll try again. And again I went and it was already set up. A complete sh!t show and total waste of time. If they have zero idea what I've already done on their site and don't know how to resolve a hold on funding my account, should I trust them with my money?This was my first week with this bank and now I'm now already debating whether to just go somewhere else with my money and close this account."
1025,1118,PNC Bank,Awful service. This bank has no ability for a check to be deposited into a customer’s account.
1026,1118,PNC Bank,Our company has had the same account for over 25 years and pnc cancelled our account with no notice no call to the owner or the company and no letter explaining why they closed us and the branch location at 35th and thomas Phoenix was no help save your self alot of headache and don't use this bank PNC sucks
1027,1118,PNC Bank,The absolute worst bank I’ve ever been with I didn’t even want to be a member of PNC but they bought out my previous bank ever since there’s been problem after problem with my business account the last straw is when the atm took 1220 dollars when I told them about it they sent the money back to my account then took it back again I’m done with PNC bank
1028,1118,PNC Bank,"To start I have never once wrote a review about any company at all ever but I felt the need to do so this time just to make others aware. I created a high yield savings account online. Within a week of activating the account it was completely locked I couldn't get in. I called and was transferred to so many departments just to eventually be told that I need to go in person to work this out. I went in person to a brach where they had no idea what was going on and eventually told me that my account was made online and I have to work it out over the phone because they have no control over online banking. I call the people back just to be told to go to a branch again. I tell them I did. Then I spend 5 hours the phone get transferred to the highest department(meanwhile I have yet to be told once about what is even going on). I get to the final department and they tell me ""the department I need does not exist for the online high yield savings"". They told me I will be receiving a call later on. 3 days later I get a call and they say they don't know what to do or why its closed. I then just beg them to please close my account and transfer the money back to the bank it came from. I am currently still waiting for the transfer. I received zero answers from PNC of why or any solutions on how to fix it. I have never dealt with such an unorganized company before and the savings you earn is not worth it. UPDATE: still no money in the account I have zero updates and have spoken with executives it is currently May 30th. Just pure gross incompetence."
1029,1118,PNC Bank,"And in customer service, with the big red dog, was outstanding and friendly! Very helpful!"
1030,1118,PNC Bank,I have PNC Bank and they suck. They charge $35 fee if you don't have any money and they won't reimburse you. They also charge a monthly fee just to use the bank. I would say look elsewhere.
1031,1118,PNC Bank,If I could give them no stars I WOULD !!! DO NOT USE PNC BANK UNLESS YOU LIKE THEM GIVIBG YOUR MONEY AWAY !!! This is the worst bank and the dumbest people work here .  They lie about transactions …. I paid a company and the money came out of my account.  But the company I paid said they declined the payment .  Which seems totally impossible because I moved money to the account just to pay a bill and to pay for services in advance because they gave me a discount.   Then the company called and said that they did release the money to them but then called me back shortly four hours later to let me know that they had reversed the charges and taking the money back from them.   But the money was still gone from my account……… PNC gave me the runaround saying that I needed to dispute the charge so that they could get the money back which they already had it back.  I talked to five or six different people and every single person gave me a different excuse and a different solution.   The money was gone from my account for over six weeks and never paid to the company that I was trying to pay.    It took about 20 hours worth of calls to finally get someone that had the money put back in my account.   Then two weeks later the money was taken out again which overdrafted my account and cost me to incur many fees…..   I even spoke to the company that they were supposed to pay and still to this day they’ve never received one penny I have since then canceled service with them and signed up with someone else.    I spoke to someone and their executive offices today and they proceeded to tell me that the money was given to the other company but we called the other company yesterday on three-way with PNC and they told him at that time that still to this day they don’t have the money from them and I’ve close the account so I no longer need to pay them.   Now I see online that PNC is giving away $400 to new customers…… and because I’m an existing customer they’re not worried about it they don’t care they don’t care that they’ve caused me to have fees and I’m probably gonna be evicted because they have kept my money and I wasn’t able to pay my rent.  Do you think these people care that they’re going to cause me to be evicted of course not !!   So unless you like your money being taken from you at any time for whatever they feel like then you should bank here but if you’d like to keep your money and pay your own bills go somewheres else.   My husband is disabled and unable to work so the little bit of money that we get plus my pay it’s just enough for us to pay our bills.   I’m sick of talking to these line people that work there they keep on pretending like the company has the money that they gave it to them and that’s a straight out lie I know this other company is trustworthy because I used to work there and that’s why it’s so embarrassing to me that this even happened
1032,1118,PNC Bank,"You try to login, know your username and your password. But they wont work after 2 months. They lock your account out. (Ive had to go through this process to pay my loan4 times in the last 6 months. This is absolutely ridiculous. Also they said that a manager would be calling me the next week and have yet to do so.) After all of this then tell you to do the password reset. Blame you that you locked your account out. We just had a lady whom is not from the USA I might add tell us once we locked our account out the phone call to get a code wont work. This was after 2 hours on the phone. Oh and we had to do the same process 4 times. We did it with the online chat then had to do it again. Hahaha why the hell do you have a password reset option then?! PnC this is garbage."
1033,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC I opened an account with your bank 23 yrs ago. Everything was outstanding. Over the yrs today would be - 10 Yes NEGATIVE 10 on a scale rating. You love to charge service charge especially during the pandemic of 2020-2021. You know when your love one of 20 yrs gets Stage 4 brain cancer & your account customer let's you know it was a pandemic which in order to care for my love one I lost my job. So of course no money was being deposited into the account once unemployment only paid for a few months. I had to wait until their office became unswamped,employed,& open in order to clear up that matter of pay. I want you to know I gave you amazing reviews over the past 23 yrs. Recommended your bank to countless people.As for next month I WILL be banking with a bank that doesn't charge monthly service fees. When I spoke with them & had a friendly,caring, experience with their employees of staff & teller's well they will be getting amazing reviews like I use to give your bank. I know the economy with money is difficult now days but when you are having issues with other agencies denying your bank customer pay so they can pay bills & have money YOUR bank. Yrs ago it seemed your bank cared NOT in the past few yrs of 2020 on.  Money order's through your bank as a customer with an account.Out rageous price for your customer's & even your long time loyal customers. When you go in & ask for coin rolls I am asked if I have an account with your bank. Everytime I conduct any kind of business with a bank I have my bank card along with my photo ID My driver's license. By the way I will NO LONGER recommend your bank to anyone. I hope you take my review along with everyone else's into consideration of making your bank amazing like in the beginning of when I opened my account & conducted business. I will NOT be returning. I stand true to the bank with numbers my family member used & they too have went down hill also. Someone close to me banked with a bank & they too had issues with their bank degrading. Guess I know why people are choosing to bank with CHIME & other ways in today's world. GOODBYE.... I KNOW THE TRUTH HURTS WHEN CALLED OUT IN REVIEWS.THATB IS SUPPOSE TO BE WHEN THOSE IN CHARGE ACKNOWLEDGE REVIEWS & MAKE CHANGES FOR THE BETTER NOT ONLY FOR YOUR CUSTOMER'S,YOUR STAFF ,& YOUR BANK'S."
1034,1118,PNC Bank,I've been a customer for Compass and PNC for over 19 years I deposited a check on the  21st this Friday that just passed and my check doesn't clear for some reason and all they could do is give me $100 for now and the account the check is from is also PNC never had this problem when it was compass tired of it and I'm taking my business elsewhere this is ridiculous my money is being held hostage for No Reason by far this is the worst bank with customer service just horrible I will never go back and never recommend to anybody
1035,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been a customer of this bank for 9 years and must say it is going downfall in terms of service and customer support.They never been ideal, but for the last several years it just became one of the worst banks ever. First of all, their app is horribly buggy, it constantly under maintenance or whatever, but too often you cant even login. Second, PNC do not stand behind their customers. If you got screwed anywhere and need to do a chargeback, don’t even try, because you will be rejected. I made a purchase at convenience store and the card was declined 3 times fir unknown reason, however the charges got posted 3 days later, PNC refused to grand a chargeback request and I lost 100$. Another example, I made a purchase online and never received my order (no shipment 3 weeks after the purchase), so I tried to get a refund from vendor but my request was ghosted. I disputed transaction with PNC and again was rejected. Within 9 years I made a chargebacks 3 times and all times no help from PNC. Lastly, for me the last straw was when I found out that my account is closed by PNC. I tried to find out the reason and customer support agent told me they dont see the reason because it was handled by a different department, so representative told me to stop by to local Pnc branch. In the branch I was assisted by some very pompous and rude manager who made some stupid jokes that made me extremely uncomfortable. Anyway, this manager didn’t provide me with any information regarding why my account was closed other than saying that pnc tried to contact me prior this and that I didn’t respond, however this is not true, I never received any phone calls or letters from them. In addition he didn’t provide me with an answer why account was actually closed, because it was not shown in the system. So after that I opened account in different bank and transferred all my money from closed Pnc account there and so far my experience with new bank is so much better. I don’t recommend PNC to anyone, stay away from these incompetent and ignorant schmucks."
1036,1118,PNC Bank,"I closed down my checking accounts when PNC took over Compass Bank, but my mortgage is still with them. A while back I paid an extra amount towards my principle online, but looking at the account showed that they put part of that pmt towards interest. I went into the bank and the teller fixed it and applied it correctly.  Today, I wanted to make another payment towards principle and decided to save a couple steps by taking the payment to the bank. I gave the check to the teller, and as he stared at the screen he said it wasn't giving him the option to apply it to principle. He assured me that all was ok, he had called his manager to find out how to do it. He hadn't called his manager... he was typing on his keyboard.... He apparently, had ""pinged"", emailed his manager. He then pulled up a page on his computer and proceeded to read! He was having to read instructions on how to apply money to the principle on my mortgage!! He still couldn't figure it out, so he ended up calling a corporate help center and the person on the other end told him that ""all he had to do was fill out a request"" for him to be able to apply it to the principle on my account!!! He said I could make the payment online in the future.... We know where that got me the first time I tried that! So, he said he was going to do that right away and didn't need me to stay, so I hurried off to work, which I was running late for. I checked my account this evening to see that it was applied correctly, and not only did I not see if it was applied to principle, but it doesn't show up as a payment, period! It doesn't exist! I don't see it as a payment or a pending payment! Yet, the check is showing in my other bank as a cashed check!!! By the time I got to check on this, it was past hours to call and ask anyone about it. So... They don't give an tellers an option to apply a payment to principle, after asking them to look up and read how to make the transaction, it is explained that they must fill out a special ""request"" form, and then they wasted no time taking the money from my other bank checking account, but don't show this payment ANYWHERE in my PNC mortgage account, much less whether it was applied correctly, to the principle on my account!!!"
1037,1118,PNC Bank,"We followed up on an offer to open a business Treasury Checking Acct, because if we maintained a $30,000 balance for 3 bank cycles we would get the $500 reward they were offering.1. It took OVER THREE HOURS to open the account, with 2 new bank reps and the manager trying to get it done.2. When we thought were were at the finish line, we were surprised by a requirement to accept a debit card. We did not want a debit card. We were told without accepting the debit card-- and using it a minimum number of times on qualifying purchases over the next 3 months-- we would not receive the $500 reward. SO-- we took the debit card.3. We were told paper statements would cost us money, so we opted for online only banking. One month later, a mysterious $3.00 charge appeared in our online statement. I called the bank rep to ask what this unexpected fee was, and she said that was the fee that went with that type of account. I asked her to show me where, in any of the website material, that was stated. She couldn't. When I pushed, she said she would have it removed. It wasn't removed.Now suspicious, I challenged the mandatory debit card and asked where THAT requirement was listed. She took a day or so and then got back to me saying there had been a ""miscommunication."" (? We have NEVER had, and said quite clearly we did not WANT a debit card, and there was a miscommunication?) I asked her to cancel the card, which she did.Next, she notified me that using the debit card had reduced our balance below the required $35,000 we had deposited... What? We had deposited more than the required thirty, and I pointed out the required minimum was $30,000, not $35,000. She said she would check on it-- then emailed me the amount was $35,000. I asked for her to direct me to the place in the PNC website that said it was 35, not 30.She stopped responding to my emails. I finally called the PNC customer support line to get this resolved. This representative said the mystery $3.00 fee was for paper statements. I pointed out we had never received a single paper statement. She immediately reversed the charge. (Why wasn't that done when the original rep said she would??)She also confirmed, multiple times and with other PNC people, that the minimum for this reward was, in fact, the $30,000--not $35,000.Won't know for sure for another 3 or 4 months whether--after all this--we actually get the ""reward"" for enduring this crappy experience. PNC withholds the reward for another 90 days after you qualified.PNC will have used our money for 8 months and between the time opening the account and the emails and calls made to correct all of the mistakes, will have sucked down over 4 hours of time. Would not have become a PNC customer had I known--not worth the $500 we MIGHT get...."
1038,1118,PNC Bank,PNC bank closed my accounts without any reason and explanations
1039,1118,PNC Bank,In am in Ft. Lauderdale area. I went to 3 branches to take out or deposit money and they do not have tellers27 years
1040,1118,PNC Bank,Worst bank ever.  Employees have no clue what's going on. Can put money easily but can't get it out. Don't bank with them
1041,1118,PNC Bank,"I've been a PNC customer now for quite some time I had a dispute in process in the amount of $1,200 it has been over 90 days PNC bank has not gotten a hold to me about this every time I call I'm getting to run around stating that it's in a different department I went to the banking branch on a 45 in Rankin location and the customer service rep tried her best to help all he said was to dispute is planning and takes 90 days well it's been over 90 days PNC has yet to get a hold to me at this point I don't really know if your money is secure with PNC Bank I remember the day when banking institutions actually took the time out to help customers reclaim their money now it seems as though we're not relevant anymore when it comes disputes or complaints they would not let you speak to the department handling it disputes and complaints which I am really disappointed on but even more on how you treat me as a customer that money is something that I really need and because of that they charged me overdraft fees still charge me overdraft fees but has not stated a word about my $1,200 I don't get it I don't understand the lack of customer service with PNC Bank"
1042,1118,PNC Bank,Poor serviceHidden Fees.Over 8 years . Closing Acct.
1043,1118,PNC Bank,Very disappointed with how they treat seniors.
1044,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been a PNC customer ever since I opened a checking account. I started at PNC because my mom had an account there. Well, I was 16 at the time and I didn't realize or understand what overdraft fees were. I went to the bank and my account was in overdraft. Okay. Being 16 years old, they attempted to charge me over $170, but were ""nice"" enough to ""waive"" half of the fees. I did not receive any alerts.About 2 years ago, I opened a credit card with my mom. It was joint so that I was able to get a credit score off of it. I had an authorized transactions from at least an hour away from me. They were for various gas stations and a different areas that are nowhere close to where I live. The transactions were also on the same day when it was not possible for me to go for one place to another, especially when I work. When I called them, they jumped me from person to person to person and I was on hold for an hour. The person I talked to accused my husband of using my credit card and stealing from me. Why would my husband steal from me? He could just tell me or ask. The lady on the phone tried to argue with me and tell me that they are my transactions for they were his transactions, or even my mother-in-law stole my card. It didn't make any sense whatsoever, and those are accusations. Very big ones. She tried to tell me that you can't ""fraud"" or ""hack"" a card with a chip. How old are you? Do you live under a rock? Hackers most certainly can! Absolutely! Instead of receiving help, I and my husband get accused of fraud. How ridiculous! I have never met any company that's willing to do that to their customers, especially when I've been with them for almost 7 years now. Their alerts lag. I never received emails in time. I get an overdraft email when my account has money actually in it. Money doesn't get taken out of my bank account until days later, which makes me think I have more money than what I actually have. Honestly, sometimes I feel like they take my money because it goes in mysterious ways. When I am overdraft, they will tell me I have a negative balance at 2:00 a.m. . Who's up that early? Who's going to check their bank account? Then they tell you if you don't put your balance above zero in 12 hours or less, they'll start charging you at least $30. It doesn't necessarily make sense to charge someone money when they don't have money at all, doesn't it? Get your act together. Don't trust PNC. I don't trust PNC. They're a scam. I'm 100% switching to Suncoast."
1045,1118,PNC Bank,"In over 40 years as a home owner, and dealt with at least 10 different mortgage companies, this is absolutely the worst one I have ever dealt with; my mortgage was transferred to them about five months ago; they do not do bank-to-bank transaction; therefore my mortgage has to be mailed to a PO Box, which my bank sends out 5 days before the first of the month, I noticed they weren’t cashing the checks until about the 12th or so of the month; last month I received a text on the 16th stating if not paid that day my mortgage will be late and I will be charged late fee, I got with my bank who confirms the check has been sent 20 days prior, they insisted they had not receive it so, I had to make an immediate phone payment to prevent the late fee; (NEVER IN MY MANY YEARS OF HAVING A MORTGAGE HAVE I EVER PAID MY MORTGAGE LATE), when they posted my payment, they posted 2 payments on the 16th, after insisting they never received it  but, lucky for me my bank had stopped the check and today is July 13th and my payment is not posted; I will have to deal with this again."
1046,1118,PNC Bank,"My issue with PNC relates to their online banking system; I don't know about other banks since I've been with PNC for well over 10 years, however, I have a lot of experience using their online banking capabilities over the years; experienced issues of 1) not being able to access one or more of my accounts' details (yes, I have multiple accounts with them...sigh), with the ""try again later"" message; 2) problems with the mobile app deposit functionality - having to take pictures of checks, multiple times and the worse one yet was having a deposited check accepted, posted and 3 days later UNPOSTED, with unclear adjustment wording, which we received an explanatory letter DAYS later after my  trip to the bank asking for the explanation and physically depositing the check again, PNC said it was due to a problem with their photo system (no bleep, Sherlock); and 3) most recently, I needed to transfer funds to my external account (has been established as an accepted account on PNC bank transfer account list for years) and the system kept saying that I could not transfer any more funds though the information screen showed a monthly maximum that my activity for the month did not exceed - turns out PNC meant a ""rolling"" monthly maximum not an actual month - really, how are customers supposed to figure that out? and these maximums they established were for ""my"" protection? I have two step verification on my PNC Bank online access - is it that easy to get through my sign in information, get the verification code from my mobile devices, setup and establish an external account (which takes quite a few steps and time to do) to transfer funds too? Sounds more like protecting their bottom line to me."
1047,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC is a heaping pile of trash, what pathetic excuse for a bank. A few months ago I got a check form selling property I wished to deposit and went to my local branch, they were changing the ATM over to PNC from BBVA so I couldn't use that, the check was too large for my mobile deposit limit, so my option becomes going inside. I asked to deposit the check and they were not capable of doing it, something with the merger, he said to use the ATM. I pointed to the fact that it wasn't able to be used. I asked what we can do, given that I took time from work and my day to do this and didn't want to sit on a 50k check. Nothing, they hve no plan in place at all, even opening another account wasn't an option. He told me I could try another ATM, which I did, but that ATM did not take checks. I followed up with customer service stating how unacceptable this is. You're a bank PNC, I should be able to deposit a check without taking literal hours from my day. They gave me the address of an ATM that accepts checks, I went and guess what the ATM was not equipped to do? That's right, accept checks, I called customer service back and they could offer me an apology, nothing of substance. I opened an account with Chase and deposited there. Fast forward to yesterday, I needed to withdraw $800. My debit card was expired and I had not received a new one, so I used my wife's, but the transaction was declined, so I called in and they said it wasn't activated (lies, she withdrew a few days before) and they had me try again, failure. So now I got transferred and he said he'd need my wife, I said I'd conference her in, but no, she has to call directly, even though they'll ask security questions. He wouldn't explain why, just that it's ""policy"". Now I decide that it's time to just go ahead and get a card printed, so I go to a bank that does that, but I call first and ask ""is there any reason wouldn't be able to print a card today?"". He said no unless the machine acts up, so I make my way there. I walk in, and I'm obviously annoyed, given that so far I have had two interactions in six months with this garbage institution, to deposit a check and withdraw $800 - I was able to accomplish neither and had spent 4 to 5 hours on both. That's just plain absurdity. When I say I need a debit card printed, she asked for two forms of ID. I was not told I needed two forms when I called. So I scrambled for an insurance card, which I did not have, then she asked about the app, which I logged into, but that wasn't enough, then she asked for a credit card and said, ""see, that's all"" (naturally I was pissed. Credit cards aren't ID, but sure, take it if this will work). She also asked about my other experience and I told her it was during the merger, ""in a dismissive tone she says that was a while ago"". Okay? So did that not happen then? But later she tells me I need an attitude adjustment, but maybe the people in your building can actually properly communicate when a question is asked instead of taking the lazy way out. Then she started getting confused because I opened the account in my old home state and asked if I had my old ID. Why? Why would I carry around my old license? Is the PNC staff trained to ask incredibly stupid questions? When you have a customer in front of you that's been treated like trash by your institution for hours, don't ask stupid questions. I told her I needed $800, she eventually got me the card and I went to the drive thru ATM, guess what didn't work? Withdrawing the money. So I needed to call customer service and ask why. Now this guy sent me a pin to my phone to verify the information. Four times he asked me to repeat it and kept repeating it wrong. He finally, finally was able to comprehend the six digits, hey thanks for listening pal. He then tells me I have a $500 withdrawal limit. $500? What is this a bank for ants? I asked to increase it, citing it's my money, if I want it, I should get it, he said the max he could do is $750. So I'd need to know why the lazy worker inside decided not to tell me getting $800 would be impossible. So I walk right back to her and I'm pissed off, as I should be, because the incompetence of this bank is astounding and tell her I need to withdraw $800. She says she's working on another transaction and sends me away and some other worker, assuming manager comes (she was likely messaged on Slack, Teams, or whatever they use) because I was irate. She asked if I was trying to with draw money. ""for three hours now, yeah"" I basically told her PNC sucked. Did she help? Nah, just stood there. So I called my friend and asked if he can withdraw $800 from the bank. He said, ""of course"". So I sent him $800 and got him to do it at his bank. That's how I had to get my money from PNC. That's how I had to deposit a check."

1049,1118,PNC Bank,Untrained staff. Alot of miscommunication. Miss the days of absolute professional banking.
1050,1118,PNC Bank,Worst bank ever!!!! I have worked for them and banked with them and they all do not care about customers. They care about making sure you know that they have the power to dictate your financial well being and laugh at you about it. They are never professional and instead yell and argue w customers and I’ve been there when they laugh at your situation. I’ve even seen where they know there’s a legitimate issue and they say send them to the branch with out even looking at the account. Too many employees full of themselves that PNC will eventually reap what they have sewed. They absolutely do not care if it’s their mistake. Oh and if you say anything they will solve it by closing your account. This place is full of ghetto employees.
1051,1118,PNC Bank,"The absolute worst please do yourself a favor and go to another bank. I mean that sincerely, and seriously. they allow you to spend money that was already spent they take money from your savings and put it in your checking after they told you no overdraft protection and now you have no savings left and now your minus money in your checking steer clear of PNC. I can go on and on and on, but the way they do banking do yourself a favor and go to another bankeven screwing me for over a year and a half and I’ve had enough so now I’m closing in my account"
1052,1118,PNC Bank,"Been with this bank since 1999. The quality of service completely went down. They will ""fee"" you to death! I just got a $3  fee for transferring money between  my PNC accounts online.  When did this fee start?"
1053,1118,PNC Bank,"If zero stars was a choice I would have clicked that. I have been a customer of PNC and its legacy banks for nearly 50 years.  I started with Northeastern Bank of Pennsylvania in1974 as a USAF cadet in Colorado Springs.  The bank took a risk on me and gave me a car loan which I paid back.  Up until now, I have enjoyed and valued the remote relationship I have maintained with PNC Bank over this five decade period of time.  I lived overseas twice during my career and moved all around the US. I never once set foot inside a PNC bank simply because there was never one near where I lived. I now live in Lynn Haven Florida.  There is no local PNC Branch in Lynn Haven.  The nearest PNC Branch is in Destin Florida.I will present the two reasons I am terminating my 50 year relationship with PNC Bank.  The first matter concerns PNC’s current policy with respect to opening a CD.  In February of this year I decided to investigate CD Rates and came to the conclusion it was time to take some money from my checking account and move it into a CD.  I quickly learned that this needed to be done in person at a PNC branch.  I decided to try and learn why this was the case since in the past and during COVID it was possible to do this over the phone.  My inquiry comprised multiple calls to 800-233-4171, multiple conversations with consultants in the sales department, one person in Birmingham Al to whom my complaint had been elevated, two branch managers, and finally a Vice President for Executive Client Relations in Michigan.  I spent the better part of two weeks investigating this and to try to find a work around.  The conversations with the two branch managers are worth noting. One was in Destin Florida. It became clear that, in her case, my problem was not her problem.  She very quickly routed me back to customer service stating the over the phone “system” was down. A second branch manager in the Tampa area took ownership of my problem and proposed an “out of the box” solution.  His approach was to offer me a special saving account rate commensurate with current CD rates (say in the 3.5% to 4% range).  I complement this individual since he, unlike his Destin counterpart, demonstrated he was willing to work the issue. I will also say that two sales consultants, who were willing to speak candidly, did admit that they too were frustrated with this situation. One admitted sales was how she made her living and if she could not sell a product it hurt where it counts - in her pocket book. At several junctures I asked the PNC employees I spoke with how they would handle a US service member deployed overseas. One sales consultant triumphantly responded that he or she would have to fly back to the states to open a CD!! That is outrageous!! I am suspicious of the statement that PNC is “working on the system” to allow an over the phone opening of a CD.  They have been working on it for several months – at least since the first of this year. -A large bank such as PNC should have a very flexible and agile IT department and any IT “fixes” should be rolled out quickly. I believe the policy is in response to some nefarious incident.  Most institutions react to bad news situations by quickly shutting down the “thing” where the problem occurred.  The most frustrating aspect to this matter is no one knows why this policy was put in place and if or when it will be changed.  For whatever reason, the information is being tightly controlled.I also don’t believe this policy came from the top. I want to believe the CEO – Mr. William Demchak – did not direct this and that he is probably not even aware of this issue.My second reason for leaving is I find PNC’s interest rates on deposit accounts to be predatory in nature.  I cite the example of my checking account which currently pays .01%.  PNC Customer Service reps cite this as the ""industry standard.""  The new bank to which I am moving pays 25 times that amount on a checking account.  When I pointed this out to one PNC sales rep, I was lectured that checking accounts are not intended to be investment vehicles. Of course they are not!   Meanwhile PNC is busy loaning funds I have deposited and paying an insulting rate of .01%.  The PNC sales reps I spoke with are too young to know that in the past PNC did pay higher rates on checking deposits. I checked again yesterday ( 6 April) by calling customer service.  The phone system for opening a CD is still down.  This makes no sense. I no longer recommend PNC. When I read the reviews from this site (around 700!) it all rings true.The bank has lost the bubble on customer service. Too big and too cumbersome.  Take your money out of PNC Bank and run away as fast as you can. Randall J"
1054,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC froze my online banking three weeks ago with no notice. Multiple reps said ""you should be getting a letter.' Three weeks in, no letter or explanation. Then a rep said I would need my verbal password (does not exist.)  Told me to come to a branch in person.  I'm disabled and do not drive.  Already moved my direct deposit to another bank.  Enough, already"
1055,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bank is only paying 4% for savings while other banks are paying 5%, I'll be pulling my money out and going elsewhere!"
1056,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC Bank is, by a considerable margin, the absolute worst financial institution I have ever dealt with.My mortgage was sold to PNC.  First, they screwed up my escrow insurance payment.  This was my first customer service experience. I came away from it kinda feeling like they were blaming me for not ensuring all info was updated.  This wasn't the first time in my life my I've had a mortgage sold, and I've never once had to contact my insurance company with new mortgage holder information.This should have been a sign of what was to come.  I updated my e-billing info with account #s and address they gave me.  Unfortunately, two weeks later they sent me billing info with same account #, but different mailing address.  First payment late.After this I started paying my mortgage monthly at beginning of month through my USAA account.  Never once has the payment posted in under 10 days. So, they never fail to give me courtesy calls at day 5.  Payments go late on the 16th and thus far I've not been late on any.After the electronic transfer took so long the first few months, I decided to mail a paper check.  Usually around 28th of month before payment is due.Guess what?  These MF'ers must have one armed illiterates handling their mail services. Again, courtesy calls start on the 5th.  Check usually clears my account by the 12th.PNC Bank sucks.  There is no way to sugar coat it.  There are problems here."
1057,1118,PNC Bank,"Horrible customer service, this bank don’t care about customers or employees."
1058,1118,PNC Bank,"My PNC account was closed due to a negative balance, after the account was closed, I forgot to update my direct deposit with the IRS, my income tax was sent to the closed account at PNC. They satisfied my account of the owed amount and never forwarded the remaining balance to me. I’m calling IRS inquiring about my tax return, while PNC had my money. The representative told me a check was sent to me, which I never received. The representative told me they will be reissuing my check that same day. I never knew banks to reissue checks that is not received by the customer without conducting a proper investigation. That’s how I know this bank is so dishonest! Stat clear of PNC they steal from previous customers."
1059,1118,PNC Bank,"Terrible bank, terrible reps, locked out of online access yet when I call they say they can’t do anything and get transferred around the circus??"
1060,1118,PNC Bank,"My mortgage was sold to PNC bank so I’ve been forced to set up an account with them and deal with their terrible technology and customer service. The app is useless and you have to call a 800 number or mail forms back and forth to do simple tasks. They messed up my PMI removal and it was months to resolve…. A dozen phone calls, faxes, snail mail, customer chats. They failed to provide monthly statements which I believe is a violation of law. I can not believe this company!"
1061,1118,PNC Bank,Having been a business customer of the bank I can assure you they do what they say and have incredibly professional and friendly employees.
1062,1118,PNC Bank,"They constantly take extra money out of my account when all my transactions have already gone through then when I call about it they ""explain"" my activity on my account insulting my intelligence and not giving me my money back of course.  You cannot take screenshots of your activity and I've noticed their pattern of not sending the email stating my balance the day before it happens.  It's been close to $100 now I've been ripped off of just since January and I'm tired of it.  Without a vehicle I have no choice but to use them since my landlord will only take cash for rent and there's nothing else around."
1063,1118,PNC Bank,I ALWAYS keep track of my payments but the fact that i watch transaction go through but then a week later im being charged for the same thing that i watched get taken out already is f-king stupid. Company is obviously horrible at their job. I need a new bank. Pnc needs to be shut down for good
1064,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC Bank better raise their 4% high yield savings rates, many other banks are paying 5%, I'll wait a week and if not time to move my money elsewhere!"
1065,1118,PNC Bank,"I am updating my very poor review from a few days ago. Money was stolen from my account and customer service blamed me for not checking more often on my dormant/unused account. They refused to credit my fees back. I immediately went into my local branch, spoke with my banker and withdrew all my money. My local branch was horrified by the way I was treated by customer service and filed a complaint with their executive branch. Within 3 days a lovely women called me from PNC for my story. After speaking with her, she told me all my fees for 12 months would be refunded to me immediately. She apologized for customer service and will now find the man that was so rude to me. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE, GO TO YOUR LOCAL BRANCH AND FILE A COMPLAINT TO THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT. They are very helpful and concerned about the poor treatment of their customers. If they don't know, they can't change anything for the better!"
1066,1118,PNC Bank,I got Covid. You would think that they would be some type of assistance for a customer but now they closed my account and decided to mail me out a paper check.
1067,1118,PNC Bank,"Where is the customer service? It has been nothing short of frustration dealing with this bank, all I need to do is pay off my mortgage. Multiple calls that take forever to get to a live person, and in end they never sent my statement as promised. Instead I get charged more interest, avoid PNC when ever possible!"
1068,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC has the worst customer service I've ever experienced. It's virtually impossible to get a live person on the phone in less than 15 minutes, and it typically takes much longer. If you have a problem that doesn't have a very simple solution, forget it. PNC has a software problem with their online account access. It's been 7 weeks now and they have not fixed the problem. INCREDIBLY, I STILL CAN NOT ACCESS MY ACCOUNT. They are so inept, I don't believe this is a viable business going forward. My family and I will be pulling all of our money out."
1069,1118,PNC Bank,PNC Tellerless banking is a joke and designed to get rid of their employees. I suggest the American People close their PNC accounts and deposit their funds in a bank that offer teller (human) services. PNC will go out of business if this happens.
1070,1118,PNC Bank,I’m a business owner and I am disappointed at pnc customer service for business credit line increase email them to gave you an answer for at least four months and the things they tell you it’s not even true  I believe all their underwriting stuff is working from busy with the family when customers asking questions they came up with very poor excuses. Don’t waste your time if your looking for business line of credit the process is 4-6 months and they no experience and the sad part is that  you have to keep calling or emailing them to get your answer.
1071,1118,PNC Bank,This bank bought my mortgage. Terrible experience. Selling mortgages should be illegal.
1072,1118,PNC Bank,Moved some of my accounts to this bank as it was conveniently located to my work .  Thank God I didnt also move my all my business accounts as well.  No one EVER answers the phone. There are no Tellers and No Drive thru at the Fort Laud location .  You have to go in and WAIT for a Rep to meet with you even to make a Deposit.  I could live with all this but not the lack of phone service.
1073,1118,PNC Bank,"Deposited a payroll check which was drawn off a PNC account.  Was told it won't be available for 7 days!  Customer service can't tell me why.  I'm closing this account and going elsewhere!!!EDIT, PNC has been great to deal with after this hurdle.  I do like their banking app."
1074,1118,PNC Bank,I paid a fee to pnc bank to stop a ach payment from coming out of my account I was assured it would not be taking out since it was more then 3 busy days before the withdrawal date . And yet it was still taken out of my account when I called pnc customer service I got no where with them I needed that money that day . Then I spoke to a manager who was very rude and told me to file a complaint and refused to let me talk to anyone else.then I called again and spoke to another customer service agent who said my money would be in my account the next day .so I checked the account today and it's not there .
1075,1118,PNC Bank,Paid 7 years on an auto loan never missing a payment. When we made the final payment we were told we would receive the title in 7-10 business days. PNC BANK lied to us and sent a letter stating if we want the title we have to get it ourselves.
1076,1118,PNC Bank,Horrible customer service do not waste your time find another institution. If you have a problem with a teller and it's legitimate you can make a complaint they do not respond and they'll turn it around and blame you for them inconveniencing you. Because of their horrible customer service I spent six to eight hours on the phone and back and forth from the branch to correct multiple issues I made a lot of complaints and they turned around and abused me because of it. They're inappropriate and abusive behavior towards customers like me is ridiculous and again find another institution
1077,1118,PNC Bank,
1078,1118,PNC Bank,PNC lost or neglected to transfer my wife's records including beneficiary upon death when they took over from BBVA
1079,1118,PNC Bank,"Online banking doesn't work a lot of the timeIt is down on mobile and desktop frequently, sometimes at the same time.Cleared cache, cookies, etc to enter PNC on Chrome and it continues to sign me out ""due to inactivity"" as soon as I sign in which becomes an endless loop. Signed in on Incognito mode but I can't download the online bank statements I need to do expenses.Can no longer withdraw cash from PNC bank tellers in Giant like beforeTried to withdraw cash from ATM. They sent me a passcode to my phone app for verification. Something went wrong and it didn't want to generate a new passcode for 15-30min. I waited and tried again, but the same thing happened. It's happened 2/3 times I've gone to an ATM for this. Poor outdated looking online banking website. The home PNC site looks nice, but to access your account you're taken back to a 1995 looking dashboard."
1080,1118,PNC Bank,"I have had a safety deposit box with N. Huntingdon, PA, PNC for over 31 years.  I wanted to open an individual savings account using cash and five United States EE Savings Bonds.  They would not accept the bonds!  Their account representative, who was very professional, checked with her supervisor and told me that I had to have been an account holder for at least a year to cash in the government bonds and deposit the funds.  I had no problem if they wanted to place a hold on the funds, but they refused to accept these negotiable Federal EE Bonds.In addition to the $6,000.00 they lost that day, I had planned on transferring a large sum of money from an online bank account I was closing.  I had also planned on opening a separate business checking account.  These funds and more will be placed in a competitor's bank or credit union."
1081,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bought my mortgage, and other than their outdated website I didn't have any complaints, until I opened a checking account.  I went to the local branch and the agent knew nothing about the promo offer, and after an hour of her making calls, I decided to go ahead and deposit the $5,000 min they require for the reward.  After 3 months it wasn't paid and trying to get my money out has been horrible! I earned $.07 over 3 full months and now that Capital One has helped me with my transfer, they will not allow me to close the account and are charging me an under the minimum balance fee, even though I have attempted to close the account the day of the withdrawal.  GREEDY AND DISHONEST"
1082,1118,PNC Bank,PNC site is horrible. might as well just mail a check or call them to make a payment. I used to just lock me out every month after just 1 attempt with password I know was right so id have to call and get it unlocked just to make a payment. Now the past 2 months the site is now giving error codes after trying to log in from any computer i try. Techs are aware they are having issues but nothing get fixed. Also if you try to have a secured VPN connection you cant even access the PNC site.
1083,1118,PNC Bank,"NEVER EVER BANK HERE!!! I experienced fraud in my account and they never supported or helped me resolve, I can't deposit cash in the bank, must go thru atm, can't print debit cards at certain locations, HORRIBLE experience after 30 years of banking at several locations."
1084,1118,PNC Bank,"What a nightmare I have had I received a letter from PNC signed ""Dru/Positive Balance Account Closure"", stating that I have roughly 9 days till my bank account will be closed where I will be issued a cashier's check for the amount in my account. When I called their customer service line looking for a reason, I was informed by the representative that PNC bank has the right to exercise account closures. That still didn't answer my question, but when I pressed her, she seemed she had no obligation to provide me with a reason. It was pointless to take at my frustration on her, because it's not her job to close accounts, it's the banks policy. I never went under balance, I didn't have much (~5000) in my current account so that could be a reason.It just sucks being dogged around like this, you're an open book to them, but they won't disclose crap to you when you're not longer a customer. They're well within their rights, I signed the agreement, it's just frustrating. It is awful after the BBVA switch."
1085,1118,PNC Bank,Good service in person as well as online. Mobile app is great as well.
1086,1118,PNC Bank,"This Bank is a scam, one having money in the account plus charging you to one two overdraft fee ($72.00)"
1087,1118,PNC Bank,"I only left one star because I couldn’t leave zero. I’m not happy with my service anymore due to the bank somehow making my card not fully active, after asking for a new card. I’ve been waiting for my new card in the mail, and I should be able to use my new card until I activate my new card. This has been such a terrible experience with PNC, and I will be switching banks as soon as possible. I should be able to access my funds in my account at anytime and anyplace. I am so frustrated with PNC I really believe they should stop banking and go into a different occupation."
1088,1118,PNC Bank,"I have never dealt with such disorganization and dishonesty. They bought my mortgage, and I got a letter from my previous lender to say not to send them anywhere payments. I contacted PNC and asked when my first payment would be due. They gave me a date, but they utterly failed to tell me that they were going to send me a bill for 2 months mortgage payment at that time. They refuse to correct their own mistake, they continue to bill me for 2 months mortgage at a time, I file complaints with the better Business bureau after trying more than once to get PNC to behave professionally, but they absolutely refuse. As soon as the rates go down again, I will refinance with anyone else. I will never ever willingly do business with PNC Bank"
1089,1118,PNC Bank,"Avoid at all costs! Mortgage was sold to them and, long story short, they’re horrible in every way…frequently providing inaccurate and conflicting information, typically failing to provide attendants with sufficient notes on account to answer questions, and refusing to to provide access to any level of support beyond those attendants. I’m seriously considering getting a new loan, at a worse rate, simply to ensure I never have to deal with again. Don’t get stuck, like me, especially with so many alternatives"
1090,1118,PNC Bank,"Settling a long established trust. Provided death and trust papers to close the account and was told ""there's a problem with a date"" on the paperwork.  PNC requiring an attorney's letter to go any further.Strange how three other financial institutions have had no problems with settling accounts for the estate with the exact same paperwork.This follows a daughter who has moved out of state and, during a visit home, was told the local PNC branch could do nothing about closing her PNC account..... she had to go to the branch where she had opened the account more than a decade ago in order to close the account.PNC is the type of banking institution that takes your money... throws it around wherever they want.... NOT IN YOUR COMMUNITY... and then makes every effort to frustrate you when you want to remove YOUR MONEY from their bank.GREED REINS SUPREME OVER CUSTOMER SERVICE AT PNC BANK!"
1091,1118,PNC Bank,"HORRIBLE BANK. The app doesn’t work for making mortgage payments, and the employees tell you that.  What kind of financial institution doesn’t have a working app to pay bills or a mtg on?? A crappy one.  I set up our online information, because unfortunately our mtg was transferred to this dump of a bank.  I set everything up, and now I can’t get in. Horrible institution.  Take your business elsewhere!!!"
1092,1118,PNC Bank,"Nerver bank with them. They never return my money when use the  Pop money to send funds. After months of going back and forth with them on the phone, they finally said they'll send the cashier check but still months of waiting but no check. Should I bring this to the news because its a lot of money they took from me."
1093,1118,PNC Bank,I just opened pnc accounts 2 months ago. And they are absolutely horrible.1. If they don’t know the answer to your question they will simply hang up.2. Zelle doesn’t work with my pnc account after 5pm while it does with my other account like capital pne or WF.3. They ask you to go to the branch if you have issue with the account even without looking at it. This is called slackerism.I am regretting having opened 2 accounts with them.4. Their mobile app sucks. I can clearly feel the difference pnc vs others. To all- do yourself a favour. Don’t do business with PnC. Go with creditunion or any other bank like capitalone or well fargo but not pnc
1094,1118,PNC Bank,"I ended up with PNC Bank when they bought out Compass Bank.  I had been a Compass Bank customer for over 20 years.  I am moving my business to another bank due to PNC's incompetence.  If you need an online bank, they'll do.  If you need to write paper checks or even deposit paper checks through their mobile app, don't go with PNC.  They stop payment on anything over $5,000.  My son's PNC account invalidated a deposit for $100 (paper check). In both cases, this was not because of anything we did wrong.  I wrote to three members of the Board of Directors and got an email and a call from someone who said all she can do is apologize.  I am moving to another bank.  Don't use PNC if you need to deposit or write paper checks.  They can't handle them."
1095,1118,PNC Bank,"I think this bank going down or preparing  for something  . They close  in my area 4 branches in short periods of time. This week they close my , my mom and my son  accounts for no reason after 25 years of relationship. No explanation, no lattes. So be aware. Don’t even think doing business with this …. so call bank ."
1096,1118,PNC Bank,"Absolute worst banking experience I have ever gone through. I opened up a business checking account to establish a relationship with PNC and from the beginning I was “red flagged”. This was later explained that the flagging came from an ACH for one of my deposits. The ACH mind you was a basic payment for products to my company. I was not able to deposit money into my account for a good two weeks while they did their due diligence. I pay for their “Pinacle” service in order to do ACH and wires and have never been able to accept or send a ACH. As of two weeks, I have been depositing money into my account with checks and cash and today again without explanation my checking account had been closed and therefore was not allowed to deposit. The manager at the branch called customer service in order to get some more information and their response was “we will send a letter of explanation to the mailing address and afterwards the client will receive a cashiers check with the funds inside of the account.” What type of bank closes accounts without any explanation or call to the customer? What type of bank finds an issue with a customer depositing money into his bank account? What type of a bank finds an issue with a customer sending and receiving money from fully verified and companies with vast history? PNC is a pitiful bank and should not be extending any service to any clients if this is how they intend to provide service."
1097,1118,PNC Bank,I am writing review on PNC back I did a Zelle payment and it went to the wrong person. On Saturday Feb 11 2023 i instantly started calling the bank to stop payment the money was send to the wrong person. On Zelle the mistake. They are not going to give me my money back long story short do it use Zelle no bank stand behind the money transfer. And now they are giving me the runaround. Don’t trust your bank no PNC
1098,1118,PNC Bank,"I work for pnc for 12 years, have a full relationship with significant balances.  My debt to income is about 10%, I have zero loans,  only a heloc with a zero balance.  I pay my credit cards to zero every month. My credit score is 834. I have a credit card from them which they originally approved for 25k, but I reduced it to 1500 years ago. I recently asked them to increase it, and it was declined. I have never been declined for anything in my life. Would you believe their declination letter stated insufficient checking account balances at PNC; what a slap in the face, my balances are quite significant.  Also stated credit card balances with pnc are high, I pay them to zero every month. I am fully credit trained,  and do lending for a living.  Something is seriously wrong at PNC imo, they are going to lose customers,  if they cannot underwrite a simple credit card. The declination reasons are a slap in the face. I would love to know their definition of significant balances.  Very mad, considering leaving them. This is based on facts."
1099,1118,PNC Bank,"I was at BBVA for years with zero problems before PNC took over. Now I’ve had nothing but problems, treacherous fees and charges because of their gestapo style banking practices that THEY CREATE only benefit themselves. I cant trust them any longer and as soon as my latest transaction clears overnight, I’m closing my account and bringing my business to a credit union!"
1100,1118,PNC Bank,PNC Oooooowe Where Do I start open a secure credit card on the advice of one of their Mortgage representative BAD ADVICE THEY REPORTED WRONG INFORMATION AND I PAID THEM 120.48WITH A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT I WOULD GET A LETTER STATING PAIDIN FULL BUT THEIR HORRIBLE REMARKS ARE WRONG WHY IS MY CREDIT REPORT STATES IT WAS PAID ON THE 23OF FEBNOT TRUE THIS WAS PAID 02/03/2023 AT THE DEARBORN BRANCH  THEY WILL NOT KEEP THEIR WORD HORRIBLE PLEASE DONOT CONSIDER THIS BANK !
1101,1118,PNC Bank,"My BBVA credit card was xfrd to this bank - I did a balance transfer because I had not use the card in years and did not want it to close. I ended up not paying it because I wasn't used to paying a PNC bill. I tried calling to get assistance paying the bill and having them verify if I had ever set up an online acct. The first rep tried telling me that without a payment I could not use the card. She basically neglected to hear that I was calling to make the payment online and I wasn't trying to use the card. She then xfrd to Cust service to placed on hold for 15 min. Not sure how difficult it is to verify if I have an online acct set up. I'll pay this off and if the card closes for inactivity, so be it but I won't be using it. This is my one and only interaction with PNC and it's been terrible."
1102,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bought my credit card account from BBVA. I charged $10k on my PNC card, not unusual for me, and 2 days later my credit line was slashed to $1,500. My credit score took a dramatic hit and I lost a real estate deal.When I messaged an underwriter, I was only met with aggressive nonsense and told to reapply in 6 months for more credit. I just paid the card off and I have no plans to EVER do business with PNC Bank. Their credit cards have one of the worst ""rewards"" programs, their customer service representatives only parrot what is written for them and their underwriters are morons.NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH PNC! There is a reason they are closing branches. Horrific lending institution."
1103,1118,PNC Bank,"Bad from day one. At my current bank, direct deposit from my Fortune 500 employer is available in my account on Wednesday at midnight even though it is scheduled to post on Friday. With PNC I never got the money until Tuesday! They steal your money for almost 5 days!! The PNC rep I called wouldn’t let me hand the call over to my wife who handles the bills and wouldn’t even let me be on speaker phone with her!!!! She was rude and said she didn’t see any direct deposit and this was 5 days later. I tried to verify the banks routing number and she refused and hung up on me!!! I’m trying to transfer my paycheck out of PNC so I can close this account and it has been 3 days and they quoted three days and my old bank still doesn’t see a transfer yet it says posted on my PNC account. MORE THEFT OF FUNDS!! STAY AWAY. Never in my life in 28 years of banking have I seen such a horrible bank!!"
1104,1118,PNC Bank,PNC closed our business account after we had provided them all the necessary documentation they requested. They didn't care nor showed any empathy.
1105,1118,PNC Bank,Haven’t been a customer in 2 years but my experience with this bank still puts a bad taste in my mouth. I’m sure I paid thousands of dollars in fees to PNC in my early 20s when I had a good job but was young and dumb with money. Their overdraft fees are legit and they continuously charge you 35 dollars every day you’re over. It’s seriously scary how much money you can end up giving to PNC just by over drafting a few days before your next paycheck. Not cool and now I am with chime and the difference in money management with them is so much better. Also their saving account has a higher yield percentage than PNC. Obviously PNC operating their many business offices and employees leads to hefty fees for their customers. That is why I switched to chime and I do not miss having an actually bank building to go to. Also closing my accounts with PNC was annoyingly difficult but worth the effort and phone calls.
1106,1118,PNC Bank,"Do not bank with them. They give you overdraft fees whenever they feel like it. If you call them and show them they were in the wrong, they act like they can't refund your money. In two conversation in two days, the first day the representative agreed that there was something wrong and I shouldn't of been overdrafted but I had to wait for a call with a manager to correct the problem, the very next day my account said they gave me two more overdrafts on top of the first one. The manager said they couldn't do nothing about it.  I deposit my every day, and I never purchased anything if I don't have the money. I do understand when things are pending, that it may be the company's I purchased from is delayed, but everytime I buy anything I make sure I have the money to do so. They have taken idk how much over the years. I will admit sometimes I made mistakes, but when I do, I learn to watch myself. But then and there automated system makes no sense.  As of now, I do not trust them"
1107,1118,PNC Bank,"problems with their staff and allowing the gov to remove money from our account that was ours because of a mistake on social security putting funds in that was not for us, causing us to be -$13k overdrawn from the gov removing money twice in 2 hrs. They allowed ss to take their money back, and our funds as well with it."
1108,1118,PNC Bank,"This month on two separate occasions while performing a debit transaction at my local retailer my card declined. I called customer care on both occasions and they were unable to explain why my card declined stating fraud prevention may have suspended the card for usual activity. I was very embarrassed by the entire situation on both occasions not being able to make my purchase and having other customers witness this difficulty.  As a long-time customer transitioning from Compass/BBVA to PNC I did not feel valued or that I had a competent team to resolve my issue. I decided it was time to allow another institution to handle most of my banking transactions.  I visited your local branch in Pelham, Al to cancel my account and transfer some funds to the new bank. The agent reviewed my account and saw my efforts to resolve the issue and stated it appears it was not the bank it was the merchant. PNC did not take the appropriate actions and I did not feel like my business was important. The new bank identified my PNC debit card chip was causing the error and I only needed a new debit card. Because I had some pending transaction and would not be able to complete my bank change until next week I went back to PNC for a new debit card. I was informed they do not provide onsite debit card and the branch that do did not have any on hand. I was offered the option to order one that will take three weeks. On the other hand the new bank provided me a debit card the same day. Do PNC have the staff employed that can provide the customer service needed to retain customers and to resolve simple issues. I am in customer service and find this level of service unacceptable.  As I am putting my concerns in written to share with this executive team this will also be the experience I share with my family and friends."
1109,1118,PNC Bank,My experience both with mortgage and credit card has been  bad. It takes ages trying to get someone on the call to resolve issues.
1110,1118,PNC Bank,From 10k of Credit Limit the y just left Whith $500 . !!!! the bank system is very bad every time you pay you have to call the bank nothing works in your app...
1111,1118,PNC Bank,"Do not use PNC for a Home Equity loan if you have very good credit, they wasted 2 weeks of my time, under valued my home by $70k, then did not have the decency to call and let me know. They send a letter out that takes an additional 6 days. A total waste of time. Horrible customer service ! LightStream approved the same amount of loan in 10 minutes with no collateral."
1112,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC closed my business account and cannot tell me why. I was given an answer that was clearly from a script, from two separate departments. I will never bank with PNC again for personal or Business."
1113,1118,PNC Bank,"Absolutely absurd this bank is still in business!  I had been contacted by the ""Customer Care Specialist"" after I had fraudulent activity on my account. I have never dealt with a more unprofessional, inconsiderate and unknowledgeable person with ANY company as I did her! I lost $500 in fraudulent charges through PNC Bank on my company prepaid debit card which I received through my employer for my paycheck. Through the last 4 months I have been trying to get the money reimbursed to my account yet the company still will not comply. I filed fraud charges one day after they hit my account when I noticed. I filed a police report to press charges on the individual responsible. I ended up filing with the government agency in hopes of recovering my money that was stolen. That was the money I saved to pay for a surgery I still need and it was stolen off my bank card while still in my possession. How was it handled?  With an accusatory under informed so-called professional customer care specialist that's denied me a refund even after being reminded the company policy states otherwise!  She has twice now emailed to inform me she has closed my case even while I am currently in discussion with the company's card services team!  It has been 4 months of dealing with a nightmare with police and finances, and this PNC employee has made everything much harder with her negligence and inconsiderate responses to my questions. What started as Mr being appreciative that my company chose a bank that was able to help in aatter like this has now turned into me seeking legal help to protect myself in order to get reimbursed for my original amount. All I wanted was my money back. This is still going on.  3 months later. I wanted what any other bank would have provided me by law. Coverage in case something bad happen. Now instead of dealing with a thief, I am dealing with much more. This could all be over had I had another person or another bank. I wish there were negative stars for this review."
1114,1118,PNC Bank,"Wish I could leave ZERO stars. Legitimately the worst business I’ve ever had the displeasure of dealing with…not bank - BUSINESS. Unfortunately these troglodytes ended up buying my home mortgage…they are equal parts incompetent, dishonest, insulting and rude. I have literally nothing good to say about them. Nothing. Nobody that works here is a remotely decent human being. May God have mercy on their collective souls. Look forward to their impending bankruptcy. Everybody associated with this institution deserves what they get then this dumpster-fire goes belly up. Stay away at ALL COSTS"
1115,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could have left a lower rating I would.  Have been a customer for 43 years, a prior employee of a bank they merged with for 18 years, and was just informed that that didn't matter. Had the most ridiculous interaction with customer service.  No more PNC"
1116,1118,PNC Bank,"This is the worst bank for mortgages ever. My loan was transfer from SNMC to PNC Bank. The representatives yell  and lie at customers. I send my loan payment on time but they after received my money go to my personal bank account and take loan payment again.  They don’t have my permission to automatically enter my personal bank account. On line system doesn’t work and no one reps can’t understand that client need have access to own loan information and can manage the payments. They take my money twice in 7 days and offered to send a refund by mail in 5 business days. When talking to the reps, I fell. I screamed in pain but the representative did't even offer to call on ambulance. She escalated the situation with her screaming at me for my money.  If someone opens the class action, I will participate."
1117,1118,PNC Bank,"OMG OMG OMG!!!!! I don't know where to start, nor do I have the time to explain. This PNC companies rep's are incompetent and speak little English. BEWARE!!!"
1118,1118,PNC Bank,"I can’t get the customer service people to transfer me to the investments people. I have tried twice in the last 30 min. Got cut off the first time. Spoke to “April” the second time and sent to nowhere, just silence."
1119,1118,PNC Bank,The Branch Manager C. Zegarra  at PNC in Journal Square is very unprofessional. He shouldn’t be working there turning his nose up at a black customer. The checks had my name on them and my ID’s matched. He was talking to me like I stole the checks or something. The fact that the checks had my name on them my ID’s matched to get treated like I was a felon trying to cash a check. Does not sit right with me.
1120,1118,PNC Bank,"Disgusted with PNC. I've had this card for years and just recently traveled to the UK, but discovered that each time I attempted to use the card it was declined. I put in a travel notification well in advance and even received a verification of such, but it still did not work. Thankfully, I was able to use my VISA bank debit card, Chase Freedom, and even my Ulta MasterCard without issue while in England. NOT happy with PNC at ALL."
1121,1118,PNC Bank,"If you're looking to re establish your credit report, you can get in touch with credit hacker webghost33 via instagram. He was able to remove all negatives and inquiries off my report after PNC could resolve my disputes on credit report. My current scoreis 789 and it can be better as well.  My wife and i use a joint account with them for three years now. Everything has been smooth until recent time since they keep having one security issues or the other. I believe PNC can do better, really a cool bank."
1122,1118,PNC Bank,Closed my credit card after a year of having for arguing with a manager. Consumers beware of this shady bank
1123,1118,PNC Bank,"Another reason I hate PNC.Talk about being hard up. Years ago, I went to the ATM and got $20 out. I had my account with PNC then (don't anymore). I needed to break the $20 into smaller bills so I went to the teller and asked them to make change. The teller asked me for my debit card, which I thought was strange, but I gave it to her. She made the change and returned my card. The next day I logged into my account and the M F'ers charged me a fee to make change. What the? Is PNC that hard up for money they charge a fee for making change? Avoid this bank, they are a cesspool, a toilet. I don't remember the exact date this happened but it was a while bank."
1124,1118,PNC Bank,"We bought a new vehicle at the end of December 2022. We were waiting until after the first of January 2023 to take out the RMD from our IRA to pay for the car. The car dealer obtained a loan from PNC so we could take the car home that day. We received 2 separate letters from PNC giving us our account number with instructions how to log into our account and that also a PIN number would follow. I was never able to log in and never received a PIN number. I called customer service 4 times, the first 2 reps were rude and talked over me. On the second call, I gave the rep my bank info and paid off this loan thinking I would get a lien release letter-wrong! I had to call 2 more times before I got this escalated to a supervisor that agreed to send me the lien release letter. I cannot say enough bad things about PNC-it is like they are stuck in the 1970's. I will never do any business with PNC again."
1125,1118,PNC Bank,"My husband and I began the process of a PNC Bank HELOC application in Sept. 2022. We are an established African American middle/working class couple with good credit and low debt. Our experience with PNC from start to finish was an EXTREME stressful experience! A process that should have taken 30 days to finish ended up taking over 90 days because PNC was so sloppy and extremely untimely in processing our application. Our assigned representative was always out of the office and very difficult to contact; Our paperwork/contract was riddled with errors and each time one was discovered, it took weeks for PNC to correct; Repeated request for information that should had be cleared early in the application process; And finally, it took 2 scheduled closing dates where we had to arrange time away from work and other obligations to attend. After closing on that 2nd., scheduled closing date, past 90 days, when we got our first bill, we discovered one of the errors that was ""supposed"" to be corrected, and we signed off on as a corrected item, was not corrected. We got so many apologies from PNC representatives along the way and afterward; Including bank manager Ingra Gelishvilli, Roxoboro Rd location in Durham NC, suggesting and promising to submit a request to her manager for approval for a gift/token to us as a result of our inconvenience and PNC's neglect. She lied! We made several phone calls and left messages attempting to contact her to make good on her commitment... No response.  Her choice was to ignore us. And to this day, we have heard nothing from Ingra. It is most offensive because this particular PNC representative (Ingra) pretended to be so on our side… She is not deserving of trustworthy!  It is sad that we as Americans have such distrust in the very institutions that should have a reasonable loyalty to its customers. That trust does not exist anymore. PNC representatives lied and had little obligation to honor our business once they achieved their outcome. Sad error for American business and consumer relationship. Disappointing experience!"
1126,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst branch customer service EVER! I was with BBVA for over 20yrs. PNC bought them and I have had trouble ever sense. I waited inside for over 20mins because they are always understaffed and if they moved any slower, they would be moving in reverse. I try to avoid visiting a branch because of this on-going issue. Yesterday was the last straw. I was at the GrandPrairie branch unable to deposit at their ATM (broken) so I had to go in. Waited the normal 20+ mins. Finally get up there and I need to deposit and withdraw. I have an old DL and they refuse to let me withdraw. Okay, let me get it in my car. I try to go back in, the lady closes the door in my face. She knew I was in there for 20mins, she points to the closed sign, smiles and waves. Really? I knock, she gives me the shew away hands and smiles. I will no longer be a PNC customer! Worst customer service experience EVER!"
1127,1118,PNC Bank,The app never works. Went to the bank to get help with it. Very rude bossy women bank employee told me to use PayPal instead. It was a huge hassle I guess to ask for tec help. Had to send money to my daughter in college. So wired the cash. The women kept writing down the wrong account numbers. I asked her if she can't do it correctly find someone that can. Then began to lecture me on zelle and why customers think they can come into the bank and demand help. I waited 30 min to be seen. Made a complaint and PNC closed my account. Had to go in and get my money which a male PNC person started to lecture me as to why my account was closed loud enough for people standing in line can hear. I told him repeatedly please stop I don't care what's done is done let me get my money and leave and he would not stop I said please walk away from me I don't care to hear why it's not going to change anything leave me alone. Was a customer since 1988 who paid a mortgage with them for 20 years.  Stressful enough to have a daughter in a situation where she needs all four tires ASAP away college. Any other time was treated very  nice until this  horrible nasty person started working at that branch.
1128,1118,PNC Bank,"Simply Awful!  I opted to take out a loan for a pre-owned vehicle with PNC because they had the lowest interest rate.  I am now regretting my choice.  Simply setting up an online account was an ordeal!  First, their website looks like a project my son might have done in his freshman year of computer science.  Not joking.  But, even getting to set an account up was ridiculously complicated!  It required receiving three different pieces of mail, (that I wasn't even aware were coming).  When I finally got through that, I just went to link my BOFA account so I could make my first payment, and what is ordinarily a very simple process was beyond baffling!  I finally completed that, only to be told that I was not eligible to make a payment!?!?!?!?  PNC needs to hire a new UX team and avail themselves of the technology and talent that is available to bring a modern and intuitive online experience to their customers!  I am seriously considering shopping around to pay off PNC and move to another provider."
1129,1118,PNC Bank,So where to start. They made my credit go down 140 points because they told me they had a bug in system. It was showing I was late on payment on app I called immediately and they said it’s just our system and will be fixed and they told me not to worry about it. Sooo about a week later got a notice credit score went down 140!!! The soo called bug took me off auto pay and I was late on payment. They did not fix it. Talked to several people and his words were “I don’t see how it’s our fault “ do not bank with them and if you do go somewhere else ASAP. A bunch of scammers and just plain dumb phone crews
1130,1118,PNC Bank,This is the worst establishment for mortgages ever.     They do not work with their customers and I have to go thru a refinance because I can't stand them - my loan was structured to not include escrow- they sent me one letter when my property taxes were not completely paid and doubled my mortgage.    The representatives are scripted and can't work with customers.   So disappointing that I have to pay to get my money the heck out of their establishment.   I am going to legally request that my loan is not ever to be in their crazy organization again.
1131,1118,PNC Bank,"Worse most ridiculous priced bank ever, 2% fee I cashed a check non customer, check was $3200 cost me $64. They verified with customer, then called pnc and verified with them took half hour. No where have I ever been through anything  like this ever, it was a disgrace don’t do business with pnc"
1132,1118,PNC Bank,PNC STOMPED ON MY DISABILITY MADE ME HAVE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AFTER PNC PREAPPROVED ME FOR MY FIRST HOME I PACKED FOUND HOME PNC CHRIS BURGER TOLD ME PNC MADE MISTAKE TO REAPPLY THEN CHRIS WOULDNT TURN IN MY INFORMATION I TOLD CHRIS IM DISABLED ONE OF MY DISABILITYS THE JUDGE SAID IS DEPRESSION I GOT BEYOND DEPRESSED HAVING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS CHRIS BURGERS BOSS DOUGLAS DELONG TOLD ME REAPPLY WITH MARIA BERRY I DID AND 8 MONTHS OF ME LIVING IN BOXES W ALL MY THINGS PACT PNC SAID THEY MADE ANOTHER MISTAKE THAT I WAS PREAPPROVED I FOUND HOME MARIA TOLD HOMEOWNER SHE WOULD HAVE PAPERS IN 2 DAYS AND DIDNT I LOST THE HOUSE I CALLED CRYING FOR 2 MONTHS THEN MARIA ANSWERS SAID SHE WAS SICK NOW INTERST RATE WENT UP I ONLY QUALIFY FOR 32 INSTEAD OF 35 000 NOW FOR A HOME I FIND ANOTHER HOME I PAID FOR 3 NEW WINDOWS 2 BE PUT IN HOME PAINT 35 WALL BOARDS BATHTUB RENTED TRAILOR BOUGHT REFRIGERATOR PNC BACKED OUT DAY OF CLOSING I LOST MY ENTIRE SAVINGS PNC PAID ME NOTHING BACK IM DOSABLED ON LIMITED INCOME IN APT WITH ALL THIS STUFF FOR HOUSE I TRIP FEEL OVER THE FLOORING HIT MY HEAD IM BEYOND DEPRESSED PLEASE HELP
1133,1118,PNC Bank,"Is this even a real bank???Unfortunately, my mortgage was transferred to PNC when BBVA left the US. Anytime I have to deal with something home related, I am on the phone for HOURS being transferred back and forth between departments that don't seem to know what they're doing...if I can even get through to anyone! More often than not, they ""transfer"" me and the phone line goes dead.What kind of business doesn't have a customer service email address??? One that doesn't care about customers, obviously."
1134,1118,PNC Bank,I would give a zero. Customer service not in their vocabulary. They are holding my money hostage and have a different answer every time. I have been transferred to many time to count and than hung up on. When I called back. Card put on hold until information updated in system. Called week later not user friendly to resolve issues I am on my own again although they have the updated information in one system and not the other. What B's they cannot release the funds then there is the 4 digit I'd code. Do you think they would offer to call for the I'd code to move this transaction forward that has been sitting there for a fing week no I am on my own as they do not give a shot.
1135,1118,PNC Bank,"Wish I had read these before leaving South State Bank who has the best customer service I have ever experienced.   Was wooed by a client who promised private equity lending.   He never was able to return a call in reference to this again.  He was the VP of commercial lending for the city.   Each and every thing that I need requires a different department to which I cannot be transferred.   Many are only available during the business day.  The services provided are minimal.  I have huge balances and am charged account maintenance.  I have to purchase my checks outside the bank.  There really is little or no support available.   Communication between ""the home office"" and local is poor.  I had to drive an extra hour recently to get new debit cards.   Now I'm told that if I want to dispute the bad transactions, I have to get new cards again?????   Never mind!   Should have never transitioned to this bank in the first place.   If it sounds too good to be true, then it is!"
1136,1118,PNC Bank,"Unfortunately these guys hold my mortgage, so I’m forced to deal with them. The online banking is pitiful and customer service is worse! I had terrible service when my home was destroyed by a tree fall. The insurance checks that they were supposed to send to me to pay for the damage were held up for MONTHS! They kept claiming that they didn’t have an inspector in my region, so they weren’t able to send out the checks. I, as a last ditch effort to speed things up, told them that I’d arrange and pay for the inspection myself to get the payment and was told no. After several month of calling( hours upon hours) I finally got the checks after showing pictures of the repairs.( why wasn’t this allowed to begin with?!!!)Now I have problems signing in on my account every month. This place is worth 66.89 Billion and has help equivalent to that of a armless man helping you load a truck.Do not deal with these incompetent buffoons!"
1137,1118,PNC Bank,Ever decreasing level of service. They used to maintain updated online records daily. Pandemic hit so i understand less frequent. Subsequent layoffs of so many people that service has gotten quite poor. Now my accounts update every 2/3 days. Any activity from a Friday still not updated as of Monday. Have to consider changing to a local credit union. Technology not as good but what use is technology if the activity is delayed anyway. Sad to say this really as I have banked there 20 years.
1138,1118,PNC Bank,Take your money elsewhere. Over the last 24 hours with waiting hours on the phone and using there online app. I'm done. The worst customer service I've experienced. I used the word sucky service to a representative and got excused of my language. I was told to expedite a new card because my account was compromised I had to wait 4 weeks for a new card. So no access to funds for a month. But if I call tomorrow before 2 they could expedite it. I waited 30 mins for this call. It was before 2 on Monday. Just make the request. So I'm done. I set up my main account to transfer my money out to transfer my balance and then I go into a loop. I verified the account 3 times. Still nothing. So now I have to waste my time with a phone call.  These companies want you to use there apps for customer service. But you always have to end up calling but there reps hands are tied. I see from simple searches that PNC is in trouble. I now know why. Customer service is myth to them. They could care less about there customers.
1139,1118,PNC Bank,Card continues to be put on hold with small charges made to card and can’t ever get ahold of someone/they put me on hold for HOURS while I’m stranded and in need of my money that is on my card. They don’t notify you either if it’s being put on hold/if they lock it.
1140,1118,PNC Bank,PNC customer service is horrible! Their banking systems are unbelievably antiquated! Cannot wait to move many auto loan elsewhere!
1141,1118,PNC Bank,Spent an hour on the phone to report a lost debit card today. Still waiting and that’s just unacceptable.
1142,1118,PNC Bank,PNC IS THE WORST BANK I WOUKD GIVE THEM A ZERO I WISH I CAN TAKE THEM TO COURT! FOR A MONTH STRAIGHT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING ALL OF MY MONEY AND ITS NOT LITTLE MONEY ITS LITERALLY $300-$600 THEY HAVE PENDING CHARGES THEY DONT TANE OUT TILL A WEEK LATER AND THEY DONT TELL YOU NOR ADVISE YOU THEN OVER DRAFT FEE WILL BE $36 I would pay that and they would still charge me another over draft they are the worst bank ever nobody wants to work for your bank every two weeks taking your paychecks and large amounts at that ! CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS SOMETIMES YOU GET FOREIGN PEOPLE THAT DONT UNDERSTAND
1143,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could give a zero, I would. Read the reviews. This bank is the worst, verging on criminal. If I cared enough I would file a class action - not even kidding - something is very wrong here. But instead I went to a different bank. This bank is HORRIBLE!!! Horrible!!! Run, don’t walk! Some CSA in Philadelphia on some remote line literally shut my account with a lot of money in it bc he couldn’t get a hold of me during business hours while I was working to discuss a complaint I had made about a CSA in Singapore who had no clue what he was talking about when sending me a replacement card. I asked to speak to a supervisor and it was solved. However this manager in Philly literally called me constantly when I was working, no appt. I kept telling him, I CAN’T TALK. I’M WORKING.  Next thing I know , the bank closed my account with ALL and (a large amount) of money in it - with no warning or explanation! Run, do lot walk! It was horrible. Caused me great anxiety, not to mention I had to move all my banking and billing. And then the customer service when trying to figure out what happened, treated ME like I was the issue. I was not. This bank is seriously bad. I wonder if they are violating any consumer protection laws. They have to be… it’s awful! But again, I don’t care enough. I moved to a REAL bank. Don’t do it. Someone warned me before I opened the account there and I didn’t listen. Do NOT bank with PNC. Do NOT! They should be investigated."
1144,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could give them a ZERO I would. Check washed for more than $5000 on a check written for property taxes. The lack of assistance to resolve this problem is unbelievable, a total run around. RUN don't walk to a Regional Bank where people can make decisions and treat you like a valued customer NOT a suspect. BTW we filed a police reports and USPS report with the Investigative Dpt."
1145,1118,PNC Bank,Fraudulent dept contacted me bout a fraudulent charge on my debit card of $450.00 from NY lottery. I live in N C and have never played NY lottery. Told the fraudulent dept no I did not make those transactions. They cancelled my card and I thought everything was fine. I get a letter that there investigating  showed it was a valid charge!!!! Well it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize that if someone has your number of course it’s a valid charge but I didn’t make it. My 2 different debit cards have been hit twice since Sept.. What is going on with security with PNC? My other bank cards have not been hit. So I am out $450.00. Thank you PNC for nothing….
1146,1118,PNC Bank,"Went to open a high interest savings account and transfer $130k but total failure. Couldn't even complete registering. Site errors and freeze ups. Finally gave up and went to Cap One site and opened an account in 5 min and transfered the $130,000. The extra point interest isnt worth this level of incompetence and frustration. How do they stay in biz? Now I see all of the pitiful reviews and so glad I didn't get to open an account. Their own incompetence saved me from them"
1147,1118,PNC Bank,"Horrible customer service for online banking, can't even send zelle payment, called 5 times, 3,4 calls they were cut off, 5th on hold for 45 mins and never got help."
1148,1118,PNC Bank,"Horrible. They can't overcome computer technical difficulties & simply try to ""close accounts"" to profit when consumer is simply trying to use their own funds! Simply awful experience repeatedly & reported to FDIC for PNC bank capitalizing for wrongful fraud. Losing long standing customers by the second"
1149,1118,PNC Bank,Got my statement on my IRA. They paid me 69 cents interest and charged me $25 administration fee. Don't get any investment accounts with this bank. The hidden fees will eat you up
1150,1118,PNC Bank,"They are okay, except for the overdraft policy.So, this is the second time that I have been charged over draft fees without the account actually being overdrawn. They will tell you that it was overdrawn on their end, but looking at your statement, you can clearly see that there was never a time that the account was in the negative. They seem not to understand that it's important to be able to know what your balance is so that you are where of when you may need to make a deposit to cover something unexpected. The first time, they were willing to refund the fees (about a year ago), but not the second time around. As it was explained to me, transactions that caused my account to be overdrawn WERE and still ARE pending, but the deposits I made that is also pending but also made available right away, but didn't somehow cover the transactions; therefore, the overdraft fees are justified. What? I have never had a bank charge fees for transactions that aren't even posted yet. Perhaps I am the only who thinks that this is wrong."
1151,1118,PNC Bank,"This bank by far is the absolute worst for customer service , knowledge, and any help whatsoever . If you need your money but they won’t let you have access because of their faults .. forget it . Count ion being continually disappointed. Horrible experience . Left me without access to my own money for weeks . Very upset at this point and will keep reviewing ."
1152,1118,PNC Bank,This people are worthless. The worst customer service around.

1154,1118,PNC Bank,"My first clue should have been that it was impossible to setup a highyeild account with them.  They offer 4% but this is not what you end with.  A standard account with less than 1% is what you will get.  At that point, it will be impossible to see your transactions online.  You will be locked out and when you do get in, you will not see a balance.  I would say, run and never look back"
1155,1118,PNC Bank,"I'm not surprised to see that PNC has a 1.3 rating. I tried twice to set up automated payments.  Their fax number didn't work, they didn't offer an online set up, at first, so I mailed in the ACH form, but they never got it.  Then they called and gave me a code to do it online, which I did.  However, now they call and tell me they can't do an automated payment until I pay the first month's payment.  I asked Tom from PNC to email me the address and amount and he said he can't do that.  All he can email is the ACH form, which they already have from me?!?  I don't recommend using PNC Bank at all."
1156,1118,PNC Bank,If there was a 0 star I would have gave them that. I called to see if I could have gotten some of my overdraft back and they didn’t help me at all there was one with .10 cents that costed me 35 dollars of over draft I have like 200 dollars of overdraft sense December that the are always late to update the money that is going out it sucks that they don’t understand that that’s to much as not help to give some of it back i do not recommend this bank for no one
1157,1118,PNC Bank,The same freaking bullcrap.. Again  Suspended my online banking for no reason.. Absolutely ridiculous as I said the worst bank ever and nothing changes so I guess I'm supposed to spend another hour dealing with this are going in in person well the h*** with that I won't use online banking and as soon as I have time I will go into the branch in person to end my account ..
1158,1118,PNC Bank,"I called PNC over a month ago, before the holidays, to request a new VISA card because the chip and strip were no longer working. Was told I would get a new card within the next week. 4 calls later, it is now January 10, over a month later, and I still don't have my new card. I was told there was a ""problem with chips from China"" and that it was a worldwide VISA problem. If this is the case, then why have I heard nothing else about this from other banks or in the press. Still waiting to receive my new card. It was really great to not have access to my card over the holidays. In addition, PNC regularly sits on deposits/withdrawals coming in and out of their bank. I suspect they are diverting funds elsewhere to earn high interest rates. Deposits disappear into the ether sometimes for days after I make them. This bank is clearly having problems. Someone should investigate them asap! (I was formerly a BBVA customer who got absorbed after the merger. I never had these issues with BBVA.)"
1159,1118,PNC Bank,"If you want a bank that ignores your instructions so thoroughly that you have to make a complaint to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), then PNC is the bank for you. If you want a bank that produces statements written in banker language rather than customer language, then PNC is the bank for you. The PNC branch where I briefly had an account has now closed. I'm not surprised.The day after the OCC received my complaint, PNC finally did what I had told it to do weeks before. My last PNC statement has information that baffles me because of the way the statement was written. If you want a bank that listens to what you say the first time and produces statements you can understand easily, then find a different bank. My credit union statements are written so I understand all of the information easily."
1160,1118,PNC Bank,"If there was any way I could leave a half of a star that would be being kind, this is the worst experience I have ever had with a so called bank , I will NEVER do business with them again and will tell everyone I can, the worst ever."
1161,1118,PNC Bank,"this bank is useless, making a deposit to logging in online to view you statement. tried to correct a looin issue over the phone with someone that tried to speak English was a loss of time. I say never go through pnc bank for any reason...."
1162,1118,PNC Bank,"I opened a savings account online with PNC.  The process itself was a mess, taking much more work than any other bank I've used. But it gets worse from there.I pushed $100,000 from my other bank to PNC via ACH.  Now PNC says my ACH withdrawal limit is $10,000 a month.  Huh?  The $100K was just the start of what I was going to deposit, but with such difficulty in getting my money out in a timely manner, I'm giving up and closing the account.  I'll have to drive 25 miles to the closest branch to do it.  Ridiculous."
1163,1118,PNC Bank,
1164,1118,PNC Bank,"I recently opened a savings account online with PNC bank.  I transferred $10,000 to the account.  Now I can't access the account online at all and every time I call them they say that my account is 'under review' and that there is nothing that they can do.  SO . . . I can't access my money and I can't speak to whoever is supposedly 'reviewing' my transfers.  This is unacceptable banking practice and I'm very angry about it.  Beware of PNC bank!"
1165,1118,PNC Bank,I've banked at PNC since I was 17. I love my local branch. Everyone is so friendly and accommodating.
1166,1118,PNC Bank,"Stay far away from this bank.  We lost thousands from a social engineering scam and the bank employees even up through management did not care.  There was no suggestions for help, what to do to safeguard our accounts or any empathy whatsoever.  I have banked with them for over 25 years with numberous products and fees paid.  And the biggest kicker was they did not like that I was angry about their lack of response so they sent me a letter telling me my account will be closed in 30 days. Wow, what a caring thoughtful institution. Be forewarned they do not care about you or your account security."
1167,1118,PNC Bank,"Charged 25.00 monthly charged out of the blue fee when I did not go below the 500.00 balance in accounts. Was able to get the first one taken off in Nov. 2022 took an hour and a half,  online PNC chat, terrible software they use or whatever it is called, (very outdated). However, PNC charged me again in Dec. Frustrated this happened again, I tried to get it taken off online, online chat,  told me to go to bank.   I am sick and contagious so I wrote a letter explaining the error in detail,  forced myself to drive to local bank and give through drive through teller. Manager came over speaker told me I needed to make an appointment to come inside and talk with her to get the 25.00 taken off. I have not made the appt. yet, because I'm still contagious.  I have been banking with Compass and BBVA since early 1990's, around 30 years. Never wrote a bad check and keep well over the 1000 in every account. I should have never been charged the 25.00 in the first place. But this is what I am dealing with now, like hundreds of others according to the complaints I've read. I just do not understand why customers have to go to great lengths to get PNC to correct their mistakes. This is WRONG!"
1168,1118,PNC Bank,"Well it the same story on line banking just on paper only  but not really exist  after spending 2 weeks open on line account ,  now I am not  able to get to log in account - simply not working . it is horrible and I am sure how they able to exist"
1169,1118,PNC Bank,"Miscellaneous withdrawals is just a polite way to say we’re stealing your money for no reason. So there’s no sure way to be positive you’ll see the same amount in your account when u login, U have to pray every time, So no Trust worthy, And if u call them about it they’ll act clueless, With Double pending overdraft and late fees added on, Glitchy online service that’s always down for maintenance, And requires 30 security steps to reset password, so good luck forgetting it and getting locked out, I could go on on, I’m surprised they’re still in business, A crime ring if u ask me"
1170,1118,PNC Bank,"Went to PNC (Southpoint, Fredericksburg, VA) today to cash a check to me and my wife.  Sat second car in drive thru for at least 10 minutes without moving. so decided to go inside lobby.  Had a check made out to me AND my wife, signed by both of use to cash for 3-figures.  The clerk ""assessed"" that signature for a good 5 minutes, then once it ""passed"" she asked the other teller if she was allowed to cash it without my wife present.  She has been with the branch for at least 30 days... and is horribly undertrained on all duties from what I've seen on this and prior visit.  She was NOT the problem however.  The problem was the person ""working"" the drive thru.  He interjected with attitude to her and to the customer (myself) and basically has also not been trained in proper customer service.  I have been with this branch through probably 3 mergers, name changes, etc.... for the last 25+/- years.  He is also somewhat new (at least at this branch).  While he was mouthing off to me and the clerk, the drive thru buzzer sounded for the client there to ask if ""everything okay in there ??  It's been a while"".  He responded how he was the only one in drive thru... and then went back to trying to argue with me about the situation.  When I FINALLY left the bank (with my money), the SAME car that had been in front of me was sitting in the drive thru waiting for money.  I went promptly to the very next bank down the street (Atlantic Union) and opened an account within about 10 minutes -- while seeing 7 customers helped between the drive thru and the inside tellers at that location.  I will test-drive Atlantic Union for a few months but am CERTAIN that PNC will soon be a distant memory for my family.  They have been a pain since before the Pandemic started, got WAY worse, and don't even see a way to recover on the horizon."
1171,1118,PNC Bank,"I had a solid relationship with the Maryland branch of this bank until they lately they started to misbehave and mess up the relationship I had with them for the past 7y.Now I’m looking for another home for my main account.The issue is with cc dpt.For what I came understand is that you have no protection what so ever if someone steals from you.I have a personal and a business account and they were fraud on both of my cc and instead of being credited as my accounts supposed to be protected,nope I got mails saying they wouldn’t refund my money,meanwhile I had never in 7y had any issues like this.I have other cc were I had similar issues and on the spot they’ve fix it but not them.Out of my accounts those are the accounts and cards I was using the most,I would say 90%,but the way they treated me and the level of rudeness they’ve used overwhelmed me and now I’m moving."
1172,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC is by far the worst bank I ever had in my 38 years of life. I had recently opened savings and checking accounts in Plano Texas my husband and I also account for our children. The accounts I opened in the spring of 2022. I recently sent on 11/28/22 a wire transfer to Madrid Spain to family/friend because they working on a major deal, my friends given me the accts prior before so when I send off the fund I was not paying attention that I used the old acct that I had before. When I noticed the error on my part I immediately reached out to PNC and told them. They said it's fine it will bounce back. Because a week past and it didn't bounce back I told them to just recalled it back, I guess they didn't want to do there jobs,I been sending money internationally a long time, apparently PNC only want you to do sending locally. Right after I asked for the recall they closed all my accounts with no prior notice. Up to this day on 12/26/22 I haven't received my money back!! PNC buy out BBVA here in the United States. I send the money to BBVA. How will I know that my funds return when my accts are all closed down. Be warm people PNC is not to be trusted. Take your money and go to a Credit unions."
1173,1118,PNC Bank,Have been with the forerunners of this bank since 2004  whe it was Compass-which was a great bank-then became BBVA was still good -then came pnc. Have been dealing with banks for almost 60 years have never dealt with a bank this bad. They will charge for the most trivial issues - have closed accounts and then they make service charges- change requirements and you won't know about it- after 18 years am closing all accounts
1174,1118,PNC Bank,Im done with pnc….other bank giving back ur money faster pnc telling u 90 days…have been scammed by someone I opened a dispute…why should I wait that long to get back my money doesn’t make sense to me it don’t need 90 days to figure out a scam…so everyone please take note I’m being very honest
1175,1118,PNC Bank,"The MOST RUDE, CONDESCENDING, AND UNTRUTHFUL customer service I have ever spoken with to date. They will lie to your face that you made a late payment just to charge you a late fee when you made it on time. They try to talk over you and make it seem like you’re wrong but they messed with the wrong one today. I’m filing a complaint for the two horrid people I spoke with on the phone today. Just a bunch of accountant managers with NO ACCOUNTABILITY."
1176,1118,PNC Bank,"I opened an account with PNC. Someone gave me a check and the check bounced and those F'ers at PNC closed my account. Why? I didn't bounce a check, the person that wrote me the check bounced it. I will NEVER work with PNC again and I will leave every negative review I can. I'm pretty sure PNC is staffed by Nazi's."
1177,1118,PNC Bank,"I've held an account with PNC for over 10 years. They follow the guidelines to handle banking properly. Sometimes they are a bit too rigid, but I'd rather that when dealing with my finances. Once you have over $50k in your accounts with them, they give you a personal banker. That really helps you get a lot of tasks accomplished much quicker. They have all the same fees as every other bank, but you won't see them in the news for running scams on their customers."
1178,1118,PNC Bank,PNC Bank customer service is horrible. It took 5 minutes jumping thru hoops punching numbers giving the system all your information. Finally reached a live person and you have to start over giving them the same information.
1179,1118,PNC Bank,"On the banking app There was a pending deduction for a payment to a chase credit card.I have never had any account with Chase, so I contacted customer service and was told nothing could be done until it was actually posted. So the next day it was posted for $420 and left me with an overdraft. Contacted the bank and the basically told me to 1. File a dispute and 2. Go to my local branch to get a new account number. So looked online and the fraudulent transaction wasn't even listed. Call the bank again and they filed a dispute at their end. At that point that transaction actually was listed online, however my account was now in the negative. I complained again that that meant when my paycheck was direct deposited It would all be taken to pay for the overdraft! Again was told their was nothing they could do until it went through. Next day my paycheck went through and as I expected was not enough to completely cover the overdraft so account was still in the red. I did go up to the local branch and tried to at least get a new account number. And was told I had to open a new account. Needed $25 to do so. I don't have $25. My account is I'm the negative and I had no cash. I am disabled so don't earn much at all.instead the put a hold on my account so no money could be taken out. Ok, fine but I told them I am disabled and need my money to pay for an important prescription. They gave me a # to call. Who could help me getting emergency credit. I did. Was told they would review and make a decision within 48 hours. That was all on Friday. It I'ts now Monday and nothing has changed. To resolve the dispute will take 10 business days, so here I am. No money, no medicine and my electricity will be turned off soon. So guess I'll just die here, just a question of how. Freeze to death in the dark? Die because I can't pay for insulin. Maybe just starve!  What I really don't get in all of this is why the hell they even post ""pending"" transactions if there's no way to do anything about them.I realize the fraud isn't PNCs fault. Someone stole my account number and used my account to pay their credit card bill. So why couldn't I dispute it before it went through and at least prevent my paycheck from being taken up by the overdraft. Even if I got some cash put in I can't touch it now until I get a new #. And then I have to find a ride to the bank to get that done. This all happened over a weekend just before a major holiday. What am I supposed to do! So 1. Why wasn't able to stop the fraud before it happened? Could have at least stopped my paycheck from being taken like it was 2. Why did they tell me to get a new # without telling me it would mean opening a new account which would require cash? 3. Why hasn't anything been done to at least get me the emergency credit? If I actually survive the next couple of weeks I will be changing banks."
1180,1118,PNC Bank,"After years having Online banking and Mobile banking it shut me out 10 days ago.  HOURS spent on phone and in person, no results, keep being told I am being sent to the ppl who will get this fixed.  They can’t, so told someone will get back to you in 3-5 days.  Very frustrating."
1181,1118,PNC Bank,"My card is shut off AGAIN!!!  I travel for a living and my card has been shut off 7 times this year.  Last week, trying to get into a hotel in Memphis the card was put on security hold.  30 minutes on the phone and I got in.  Tonight in Savannah, GA I cannot get a rental or into my hotel!!!  I have been on hold 3 hours!!!  My company forces us to use PNC credit card.  It is AWEFUL"
1182,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC Bank on 8th street Fernandina Beach FL. My husband and I have tried repeatedly to get our bank statements needed for a mortgage. We went in 3 days in a row and was denied help. They told us to do it ourselves online, when we tried to retrieve them online it said we didn't have an online account. We do have an online acct so i called the bank and they said it was a glitch in the system and to come in and they would print them for us. That was a lie! We went in to get them only to be told that wasn't possible. This bank has refused to help us, they didn't care that we needed it for a mortgage and was on a time limit to get this paper work in. We have tried several times to get them online but the online banking app wont give them to us bc of a glitch in the system, like that's our fault??? This bank is poorly run, poorly managed and the customer service is disgraceful! Do not bring your business funds or personal funds to this bank! They could careless about you or your family!!!!!!!!!!"
1183,1118,PNC Bank,It appears the corporate decisions of PNC has reshaped what at one time was a excellent product to more money into investor hands. Over the years I’ve noticed the customer service went from great to terrible. It appears all customer service jobs are not in the United States to pay for lower wage workers.  The foreigners can be difficult to understand.  I recently had a theft of $2000.00 dollars from a company called remotely a foreign exchange company.  I have never had business with this company in my life and PNC attempted to blame me for the purchase.  I proved them wrong and got my money back.  If you were a investigator would you suspect insider threat since most of the customer service is foreign with access to our accounts ?  I had an account with this company since 1995.  I recently closed my account and I do not recommend using PNC Bank
1184,1118,PNC Bank,"A few weeks ago my SO struggling with addiction managed to find my personal ATM, ninja style at 430 am and removed $200 from my account, he also rummaged and managed to find a single check which he forged ... I reported this to PNC and was given the provisional credit for the ATM charge, as directed I also filed a police report for both. This has always been my own account...PNC has determined that a withdrawal of 200 at 430 am was a valid transaction and took the credit back...now I feel violated all over again! Theft is theft, no matter what, but again this drug addict gets another pass! Btw I did toss him into a detox and terminated the relationship. People wonder why women stay stuck! Well thank you PNC for yet another shining example on why Domestic violence stays the course as a norm in the US"
1185,1118,PNC Bank,"Great savings interest rates, 4%!! Very friendly branch in Sacramento!"
1186,1118,PNC Bank,I have been using PNC for a long time.  Am  disabled and use their on-line system.  Able to transfer funds from savings to checking without leaving home.  Never had a problem but I don't use cash as I am housebound.
1187,1118,PNC Bank,"The branches have all gone 'cashless' so you can't deposit or withdraw your own money at a branch, which is insane to me. The website and app (or both at the same time) are constantly not working. It's a lot of fun to not be able to manage your business checking account in any way while both are down. If you do try to withdraw money at a branch, they treat you as if you're sticking the place up. Just an overall awful experience and I've had my business account with them for over a decade. It's a pain to get everything changed over to a new account when you use a bank for business banking, but it's time - this bank is trash."
1188,1118,PNC Bank,PNC bank steals money.....I Have had over 1000 dollars stolen from me by PNC by taking double Pending transactions. When I call the bank NOBODY knows what their doing at all.Never can get a Supervisor and they don't refund at all just be lying. I advise anymore to not bank with this bank and if you do remove yourself.
1189,1118,PNC Bank,Fees on top of fees and they are just getting higher.I have a business account and credit card with them.Why such high fees for every little thing?
1190,1118,PNC Bank,"We have been with this bank since 2008 when it was Compass Bank, BBVA and now PNC.  We have our business accounts and personal accounts with them.  They still have not been able to link their credit cards to a single account of ours.  THEN a letter arrives stating they're lowering the credit card limit with NO late payment history.  I would HIGHLY recommend putting your money in a mattress before banking with this bank.  Simply put they're terrible to work with and their customer service is NON-EXISTENT! Dang I miss BBVA!"
1191,1118,PNC Bank,"I’ve had the pleasure of having Kimberly Stennis take a rather disappointing experience and turn it around. Total 360 degrees! Exceptional customer service skills in her wheelhouse! Trust me! Don’t lose her, an absolute asset!Regards,Christine Fowler-Neal"
1192,1118,PNC Bank,Your manager at the Sellersburg Indiana branch is a dishonest liar. Why are your tellers and all your employees so rude and snarky? I don't need this behavior from my bank! I'll bring my business somewhere else somewhere. Your bank is terrible
1193,1118,PNC Bank,Our latest login problem on PNC's website: error xxxxxx please try another browser or call us. Called but put on permanent hold. Chat hung once it determined that a caned answer would not help me. Tweet - no response. Now looking for a new bank.
1194,1118,PNC Bank,"(1) PNC takes roughly 5 days to transfer $ to a linked checking account at another bank. When PNC says they're ""waiting for the transaction to clear"" on the phone what they mean is, ""We're earning interest for several days while we make you wait for own money"". I have several online accounts at other banks and not one of them takes as long as PNC does. My other banks are either same-day or 48 hours. (2) In order to add a payable-upon-death beneficiary, PNC made me take time off from work to go in person to a branch. I opened the PNC account online, I get my statements online, and I've added my relative as beneficiary to ALL of my other accounts online. Not that hard. Name, Soc. Sec., address of the beneficiary. However, having gone to an office, my relative's name now appears under my own, as if she's a co-owner. She's not. (3) IF there's an office nearby, PNC savings accounts earn a lower interest rate than what their advertising says. One of those small print things. Bait and switch. I didn't want an office, but I'm paying for it. (4) I'm now on my 3rd call to try to close the account. They're simply awful. Sleazy."
1195,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been unable to access my account online from my mobile device or my computer.  When I call and someone does answer after 20 minutes they say wait two hours.  It has been three days and still not working!  I'm ready to withdraw my checking and savings account and go to another bank.  Horrible customer service and phone help is useless.Today, 3rd day, I finally spoke to someone who helped me.  His name is Reese, very knowledgeable and patient.  Was able to fix my connection problem in a short amount of time. Thank you!"
1196,1118,PNC Bank,"The PNC mobile app works well, most of the time. However, it has one inexcusable glitch: it doesn't recognize my password every once in a while. When this happens, I have to delete and reload the app and choose a new password, and then change the old PNC password on the PNC Bank website, on my laptop. It's very annoying, and, a little troubling. It makes me think twice about keeping my money in a bank that can't even design a reliable mobile app."
1197,1118,PNC Bank,About sick of PNC online banking app!! Every time try to go on app. Can’t because always updating or something!! ALWAYS SOMETHING!!! I’ve been with PNC for 15 years.
1198,1118,PNC Bank,I'm also a former BBVA customer whose account was bought out by PNC without my consent. I'm a retired bank officer who for 35 years worked for major US banks. I find this bank's staff and service to be much below industry standards. Their non-caring attitude leaves much to be desired. They keep adding junk fees to accounts that are not even being used! I'm closing my account at this miserably run bank!
1199,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could give them “0” stars I would. 6+ months on a Line of Credit refinance! With >70% equity in the property! >800 FICO score! >$100k/year W-2 income! With an existing business account, mortgage, LOC, and another joint account! All lies, deception and general ignorance! Proof their practice is based on bait-n-switch nonchalant attitude with a lack of urgency. Closing everything and moving elsewhere. Good Riddance!"
1200,1118,PNC Bank,The PNC Credit Card is A Crook in Disguise    If You Pay Your bill on time and Accrued cash reward your card will be put on Hold. That’s where they try to Reap the benefits because if your card is On Hold Then You can Not Make a Payment but the Interest Will accrued Over Time until You get In Off Hold Which of Course You have To call and Talk to One specialist agent who is authorized to Take It Iff Hold. Well Do You Think You can Speak To This Person. Of Course Not. I Waited two hours and am actually still waiting to speak to Him Or Her to Unhold my card because if I Don’t The Interest just keeps going Up.  Unbelievable Evil in This World Just for A Bit of Money. Was Angry no am Very Sad for Our Mankind and the Extreme Greed That is Out There.  Just take mine along with everyone else in this reviews.  STAY AWAY FROM PNC IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR FINANCES
1201,1118,PNC Bank,"You now have to make an appointment to goto the bank. I have a checking and money marketaccount and only use my home computer buthave to go through 2 step verification--EverySingle Time. Annoying.To top it off, the interest rates are below norm.I am ready to close all the accounts."
1202,1118,PNC Bank,"OMG, what are you doing to stop thieves taking my money, don't you have expects in security and technology, you have to be ahead of these crooks!"
1203,1118,PNC Bank,"Horrible banking experience!! Came from BBVA and never had a problem with them then they were bought out by PNC and that's when the problems started. First it took me 3 weeks to get my bank card. That should have been my first clue. After that I started to notice transactions I made would randomly appear and disappear from my acct. I only have this account for daily expenditures (gas, food etc...) so I like to know exactly how much money I have in this acct at any given time. Because of this problem I cannot rely on the banking app. Example... Sunday I have $1000 in my acct and I use my card 4/5 times Monday and Tues and when I use the card the money is deducted from the acct. then on Wednesday 2,3,4 or all 5 will be removed from my acct like they were never there and money put back. They will be gone for 2/3 sometimes 4 days then just reappear. It's almost like they purposely do this to try and get you to overdraft. Until I switched banks I had to dig out an old bank book I had to physically write and calculate every time I swiped my card. What's the purpose of a banking app if its not current.  I talked to pnc numerous times about this issue and they swore they do not remove transactions. They said the merchant does it??? Kinda odd the same merchants didn't do this when I had BBVA. Not only that the app is down without warning more times than it should be and always at the most inconvenient times. I put up with this nonsense way longer than I should have. Everyone I know that was like me coming from BBVA have left PNC as well."
1204,1118,PNC Bank,Customer service is bad as it gets with their online account. If you don’t believe me.  Give them a try. Lol.
1205,1118,PNC Bank,"Oh where to start. Let’s begin with BBVA, a fine bank that treated their customers with professional service and awesome respect.PNC, the bank that acquired BBVA, is the complete opposite. Upon my father’s passing, they’ve provided me with inaccurate information and incorrect forms and during these days of trying times reprehensibly, they simply didn’t care.I had to continuously pry for responses, at times agents would not follow through with my requests, or I was simply “ghosted,” or ignored until I became persistent.Trying to reach the source of their policy and procedures, I’ve found that impossible.I do feel sorry for the tellers who once were employed by BBVA, a wonderful bank, and now they have to contend with PNC- I could see the sadness in their eyes and demeanor. I’m in the process of transferring my PNC account to a different bank.By now you would realize I absolutely do not recommend PNC nor their callous practices; however, I do sorely miss BBVA.Edit 01/14/2023- after approximately six weeks waiting for answers that really didn’t address my questions about the errors on their part and their refusal to correct them, I forward a complaint to the Attorney General’s Office in my State.This is how PNC functions and more appropriately-egregiously malfunctions."
1206,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst bank ever. Can’t deposit a check and have funds available right then. Opened a new account. 2 weeks later still no card has been sent. Bankers couldn’t tell me anything but to keep waiting. Couldn’t even make a purchase or transfer funds using my account number, they still couldn’t give me an explanation for that. My money was stuck in this bank and I couldn’t get it until I physically went and withdrew every cent I had in there. I have bills that have to be paid online and couldn’t. I had bills late because of this. Absolutely ridiculous and I won’t ever put another penny into this bank."
1207,1118,PNC Bank,Closed my account without any prior notice.  Do not bank with these people for any reason.  Horrible customer service....
1208,1118,PNC Bank,"I just received my checking account statement.  My balance is $5,100.00.  I got paid 5 cents for this month!  That is 60 cents per year and equals .012 percent per year!  Now I know a checking account to a bank is a liability, but they're holding MY money.  When they charge 24 percent on credit card unpaid balances can't they pay checking account holders more than .012 percent!  But I do realize they are no different than other banks; they're all legal thieves!"
1209,1118,PNC Bank,Pnc bank is terrible
1210,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC makes it very difficult to pay your loan off early, and I did not receive any confirmation that my payment had been received.  When I contacted Customer Service (also very difficult), I spoke with a very rude agent who was not in the least interested in helping me and who was curt and impolite, to say the least"
1211,1118,PNC Bank,"Keeps declining payments - even though I have many times that amount in my account. Am switching banks - I have perfect credit, and yet I now find myself behind on multiple account - because for some unexplained reason PNC keeps reversing payments - avoid this joke of a bank."
1212,1118,PNC Bank,Worse bank I ever had I have a chase and navy federal account both are 100x better the pnc unfortunately I had pnc first pnce I pay off my personal pnc loan I closing pnc account for good
1213,1118,PNC Bank,"Without warning, PNC froze my checking account. I had over $950 in accessible funds. I had deposited a $400 + check, and $960 cash the day previously. I had rented a uhaul truck to buy heavy construction supplies from a store. Took a day off from work, spent close to $200 on the uhaul truck.After several hours of picking out building supplies, I drag approximately 1000 pounds of building materials all the way from the rear warehouse, through the entire store. With 1000 pounds on a dolly, it was difficult. After waiting in line, I go through the process of checking out. My card comes up declined. Mind you, I put close to $1500 in the day previous. I try again. And again. Declined three times. Now, I’m embarrassed, there’s a bunch of people in line. I check my account balance for my primary virtual wallet PNC checking account. It reads $958 of accessible funds. I am purchasing $508 of merchandise, so what is the issue?I contact PNC. first guy disconnects the call unexpectedly. Maybe it’s bad reception? I call again. Menu prompts, finally get to PNC employee. I explain the situation. I have 1000 pounds of building material, my card is declining at checkout, I need help so I can complete the transaction.I am put on hold two times. Finally the PNC employee informs me that there is a freeze on my card and I need to talk to a specific department to unfreeze it. The employee that informs me that the current wait time is 60 to 90 minutes. I reiterate that I am in the front of a line with 1000 pounds of construction material. IThe employee gives a fake canned insincere apology, saying I would need to wait for someone else to lift the restriction PNC imposed.No one had contacted me or informed me of any reason for freezing my account. No emails, text, phone calls. Without any warning, PNC froze my account.I had been trying to be patient, but the lack of empathy or consideration for the grief PNC was causing me unnecessarily sent me over the edge. I informed the staff this situation was bs, that they were playing games with my money. I am a grown man trying to utilize the money that I earned and deposited into their bank.No empathy for the stress, embarrassment, frustration or financial losses this situation was causing me. the PNC employee ignored my grievances and complained about me swearing and having an attitude.Yeah, I’m gonna have an attitude when you freeze my funds, don’t contact me, don’t explain why, and refuse to address and correct the issue.The employee was being antagonistic. I explain how this situation is causing me tremendous grief, the PNC employee responds with “I’m sorry YOU feel that way.” …passive aggressive BS.The PNC employee then informed me that she would be discontinuing the call because of my swearing and disrespectful behavior. I didn’t start off swearing or disrespectful… Then the PNC employee hung up on me. I then waited on hold for nearly 2 hours, for someone who “could assist me”. The freeze was lifted pretty quickly, and the explanation provided was bs. They claimed my chip on debit card was acting up (sometimes not reading), so they assumed my card was fraudulent and locked my account. I’ve had this account for over 8 years, nearly 9 years. They didn’t reach out, just froze my account.PNC created an unnecessary problem by freezing my account. By the time they finally unfroze my account, the store had returned all the merchandise to their original stock locations. I had spent several hours gathering the stuff and labored to bring the material to the front of the store.Not only was my energy and time wasted, the poor store employees had to spend time and energy restocking 1000 pounds of construction material.By the time the “issue” (ie the bs drama PNC created) was “resolved” (ie - they finally stopped playing games with MY money); the store was about to close, my merchandise was gone, I lost a day I took off from work for, and my uhaul rental would need to be repeated. PNC played games with my money, prevented me from completing my business, and cost me nearly $200 in needing another uhaul rental, and another day to do something that would’ve otherwise been completed today.I lost money, time, and suffered unnecessary stress, anger and embrassment…because PNC decided to play games with my money."
1214,1118,PNC Bank,"If you need to finance a car, dont do it with PNC. Their rates may be in line. But once you pat off the loan, you’ll get a major run around to get your title. First they tell you they mailed your title, when it never arrives you find out they never had your title at all. Then they tell you we sent the lien release, again no lien release ever arrived. The statements and monthly bills make it to my house from PMC  but not MY TITLE/lien release. When you ask them to mail it again, they tell you they will not. After repeated calls they then send you to a title site. Where they are the main bank listed. You then need to pay $26.00 for a lien release letter, go spend half a day at the dmv, lose time off work and then pay DMV $100 to get your title. Stupid me , i let this happent twice, but never again"
1215,1118,PNC Bank,"When once  took over bbva all fees went up. Service went down. I never signed anything  with pnc. Account  fees up ,overdrafts fees up. Service down"
1216,1118,PNC Bank,"Had a family emergency and my cousin, who is a PNC Bank account holder (checking, savings, and investment account) went in to her local branch and filled out a request for domestic wire transfer and provided all needed information. Got a receipt and reference number. No wire was ever sent to my Texas verified bank account. The next day, still no wire initiated and pnc employees called and verified with my cousin who I was etc and she obvious verified. (No one said a thing when she was in the branch in person the day before!) Still no wire went out. I even called pnc myself and told them who I was and asked could they please verify my bank, etc and was there anything I could do to help prove I am legitimately me! Nope. Finally, after 48-hours of no wire sent they call my cousin and decline the wire request saying too risky. What the hell??!! The duress was real! Put us in a jam and a wire is a wire for a reason! Fast funds! It was obvious we were not scammers. My bank was surprised at their action too. We went the extra mile to verify anything and everything. Horrible experience!!"
1217,1118,PNC Bank,"Today i made the choice to leave PNC. I’m not upset , I’m simply learning to take my business to those that deserve it! What played a part in my decision to leave was:Website was constantly unreliable, notary in branch was unavailable (causing me to have to pay elsewhere), not being recouped for $15 fees after pnc closed my acct for another and then didn’t properly move over my $ causing me to wait 3 1/2 weeks for it to be moved, workers seemed Unknowledgeable, long wait times on The phone..only to be hung up on..wow!. PNC you have a lot of work to do. 2 stars out of 5 is considered failing in my book. Customers deserve better Leaders."
1218,1118,PNC Bank,Worse customer service and bank I have experienced. Multiple mistakes made on their side when opening a young savers account for my teen- took hours to get his money refunded. Will not allow you to cash or deposit a check made to your minor child- insists that the 10 year old has her own account when dealing with a small amount of money. Do not bank here if you have kids you will need to set up- there is nothing easy or family friendly about it.
1219,1118,PNC Bank,My account used to be BBVA.  One of the finest banks I have ever used.  They were apparently bought out by PNC which appears to be pretty terrible.  Extremely clunky and difficult to navigate payment portal.  Took 30 minutes and multiple tries to pay my bill. Every month paying my bill is a new and frustrating challenge. I would avoid this bank and wish they had not bought out BBVA who understood good customer service.
1220,1118,PNC Bank,"I waited over 20 minutes in the drive-thru. This is unacceptable on all levels. If there's a problem and your branch is open tell the customer to park and come in. Once I pulled up put my deposit in the chute no one came on the monitor to say hello, or even sorry for the delay. Waited and the sent back my transaction done. I had to push the speake button 3x before someone came on the monitor. I then said how rude and you should have acknowledged me and said hello absolutely nothing. Then I said any apologies and the clerk said we're so busy and n I said what does that have to do with acknowledging a customer smh. So through with this Oxon Hill branch so disgusted. 35 minutes of wasted time."
1221,1118,PNC Bank,If I could give them a 0 I would this bank has ripped me off and I have the paperwork to prove it. They charged me with so many fees it’s really unbelievable. I would not never recommend this bank to anyone!
1222,1118,PNC Bank,
1223,1118,PNC Bank,"I started making Auto Loan Payments in June 2022. I would pay the loan amount and $500 extra every payment. The next time I made a payment it said I owed much less than my payment. I called and ask what the deal was and they explained that they just keep the extra I pay and put it towards the next payment. I explained that I'm not 4 years old and I can keep my extra money myself and I want the extra to go towards my principal. The nice Lady said she would straighten everything out and back date my $500 to principal. Well here we are in November 2022 and I'm still making calls trying to get this sorted out. I can go on and on about other issues with it, like saying I was pass due when my account clearly shows every loan payment was on time and there was always extra paid on the principal. Horrid experience and as soon as this loan is paid off I will never deal with them again. Brian."
1224,1118,PNC Bank,PNC recievied my ACH payment then said that my bank did a stop transfer. So I checked with my bank and waited 3days. My bank said and verified that they had not stop nor recievied back my funds. I  recievied paper work from bank went to PNC to report and give them the paperwork from my bank. PNC then said it has to be your bank or you did something wrong when you set up ACH. I set everything up lime there paperwork and customer service said to when I called the verifie I had done it right. Because PNC had just taken over my mortgage acct. Now going on 5 days later. They say it will take upto the 28th of the month to find out wrre my funds went to. And now I can not even set up next month's payment until this matter is taken care of.  Worst customer service I have ever had.  They make everything your fault and tell you so.
1225,1118,PNC Bank,"TELLER, KAYLAH  AT THE MOBILE,AL BRANCH WAS SO VERY VERY PLEASANT & PROFICIENT. WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE"
1226,1118,PNC Bank,Try to make some more facilities to improve the performance.
1227,1118,PNC Bank,this bank sent me a credit card offer. i have a 780 credit score and they choose to not approval my credit. they jush want my information
1228,1118,PNC Bank,"Went to cash a check at video teller machine. Money didn't dispense. Video teller said someone would call me and never did. Call everyday for 4 days and nobody from the branch or customer service knew anything about my $1,200.00. Finally got through to main office in Pittsburgh  and got a call back the next day. They told me they are investigating and it could take 45 days for them to send me a check. I will be filing complaints with every agency I can against pnc. This bank is the worse."
1229,1118,PNC Bank,"Control is what they are all about,as long as they have control they are cool with only one open brach on the weekend,they are ok with staff members being rude to the point of placing someone in front of me in line like I did not exist all because I was the only minority in the branch at that time said he didn't even see me. I'm blown away they also wanted to charge me 77$ to have express funds deposited into my account from a vendor we do Business with all the time and they know it. It's disgusting the cashier was rude."
1230,1118,PNC Bank,Most pathetic customer service ever. You can tell you’re talking to someone in their pajamas with a cigarette in their hand. Apparently zero training to answer the phones. They just don’t know what’s going on with their own system.
1231,1118,PNC Bank,"According to PNC, I cannot make payments on consecutive days to the bank. They will not allow it. I tried to do it online three times today to pay off my credit card balance. A message popped up each time and said that it was not possible to make payments on consecutive days (I made one yesterday.) Not believing this to be possible because I have done it before, numerous times, with the other banks I use, I called customer service. A rep in Malaysia tells me ""making payments consecutive days in a row will over ride the system."" It's a freaking bank. I am trying to pay them money for my credit card balance. A bank's job is take a receive money.  How can you not accept payments on back to back days? What a joke. Canceling my account with them immediately."
1232,1118,PNC Bank,"i absolutely hate this bank, i actually liked it when it was BBVA but now that its PNC i hate it. i started getting charged monthly fees the only reason i haven't switched banks is because i barely set up my direct deposit but hopefully soon i can switch banks! DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BANK!"
1233,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst customer service ever / thanks Marina for nothing and disconnecting the call when I asked for your manager / love how these dumb associates who make 10 bucks an hour can hang up on customers that pay their salaries / closed all my accounts due to this awesome service / bye PNC, get your people in check"
1234,1118,PNC Bank,"Most worthless bank I have ever dealt with. Had a credit card and checking & savings with BBVA. All BBVA accounts got transferred to PNC, and after that the fees started happening. My accounts remained dormant for over a year, paid off my minimal credit card balance with them. Started getting a low balance fee on my checking on a monthly basis from them. I finally called them and closed the online banking accounts today, only to find out they also closed my credit card account due to inactivity. This is not how you maintain good customers. Like I said before, a totally useless bank."
1235,1118,PNC Bank,"They pay no interest, mishandled a takeover of another bank and ruined that banks system. Stay away."
1236,1118,PNC Bank,"The West Grove, New Jersey branch provides the worst banking experience to customers attempting to close out a custodial savings account for a deceased loved one. Lisa DeFilippo, the branch sales and service representative drew the process out for a month, did not follow up on document submissions, and gave incorrect information regarding the process. I was told to return with Surrogate/ Executor paperwork so that the custodial savings account could be transferred to my name and that then I could do whatever I wanted with the account. After calling three times and returning a third time, I was informed that checks would be issued in the minor’s name for $100 and a now adult child’s name for $15- yes, minimal amounts.All bank representatives should be well versed in the process and courteously guide estate executives through the process. Customers should not have to return multiple times and contact the bank and branch manager for assistance. George Maloney, the branch manager was unable to assist in Lisa’s absence and refused to honor the process of transferring ownership to the executor as outlined by his bank representative. He also refused to disclose contact details for the legal department to verify the account closure process. PNC Bank should ensure that its representatives are informative, transparent, accountable and offer expeditious support to customers. Multiple patrons of color attempting to close out accounts or transfer ownership of accounts experienced insensitive service at this branch. Cultural sensitivity training would definitely benefit the employees in charge of assisting customers at the West Grove branch. Due to the highly disturbing interactions today between myself and another patron following me, PNC Bank has severed its opportunities for future business."
1237,1118,PNC Bank,Slow to get a card and direct deposit was slow USE another bank folks
1238,1118,PNC Bank,PNC has become a very impersonal bank.  They no longer care about their customers.  They are complicit in fraudulent activities by not clearing checks before releasing funds
1239,1118,PNC Bank,Would leave 0 stars if possible. I never even signed up for this bank. I was transferred from a closing bank without my consent or knowledge. Tried to get my money and they have closed my account and kept my balance for fees. What fees? What account? I never signed any agreements with you. I never even activated the card you sent. I want my money back!!!
1240,1118,PNC Bank,"I visited the branch at Kirk Rd and Forest Hill Blvd a week after my mother's passing to get some information on her checking account.  My brother and I are on the account as well and we wanted to keep the account open for a while to keep her auto-pays going until we settled the estate. The lobby at this branch was empty when I entered and I got a really rough greeting from the teller. I told her why I was there and the information I wanted. She had a cold look on her face as she took my mother's information.  Not even a ""sorry for your loss"" sir.  She went into another room to destroy my mother's debit card and came back to tell me that they will not unlock the account and that I would have to have my brother present with me if I needed anything done with the account. That's it. Not even a sorry.  So I just walked out before I caused a scene. My brother arrived the next day from N.C. and we went to my mother's original branch on Okeechobee Blvd. The whole staff knew my mother. She's been with PNC for over 15 years. Not only did they greet us with condolences, but they unlocked her account and I'm able to keep it open for a little while to settle any debts she may have had. I should have gone to this branch first but the other branch was closer to my home. I'll never visit that Forest Hill branch again."
1241,1118,PNC Bank,I had a customer pay his final invoice with a personal check from PNC bank this was the second check this customer had written my company drafted on the same account. They marked it as fictitious or altered and returned it to my bank. They did not contact the check writer to see if it was valid before doing this. This caused a tremendous amount of hardship for my company as it froze my business bank account and all of the funds in it pending the replacement with a certified check and proving that it was not an altered or fictitious Check. I’m all for safety and security but this was absolutely uncalled for and very poor service when a simple phone call could have saved both myself and Our mutual customer a lot of heartache. Very poor business practices.
1242,1118,PNC Bank,So several thousand was stolen out of my account and I noticed the bank the next day. Even drove there and filed a dispute. And pnc won’t give my money back to me claiming it wasn’t within the 60 day period to let them know it happened. I did it in less then 24 hrs!!! I hate this bank. I’ve been with them over 15 years and this is how they treat me. I am getting a lawyer. Next step
1243,1118,PNC Bank,"I've banked with PNC for over 25 years. Earlier this month I went to my local branch and locked in my equity line. I received an estimate for the monthly payment and a locked %rate that day. I was told the monthly payment may vary slightly from the estimated they quoted me. I just received my new monthly statement and PNC is charging me 22% more than the estimated payment. When I questioned them, I was told, sorry, but it's out of our hands, it's just the way it is. No mathematical explanation and they refused to reimburse my $100 fee."
1244,1118,PNC Bank,"I only rated a 1 star because i had to choose something to do this! 0/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BANK! Here’s my experience…DO NOT bank with PNC! Friday i was wondering why my checking account was showing 0.00 KNOWING i had money in it! I mobile deposited my work check Friday, and it wasn’t even pending. So I’m confused af. I called customer service today to find out that my account has been placed on HOLD because they have decided not to continue our relationship as bank and customer. NO WARNING! NO CALL! NO NOTHING! Just no access to MY MONEY out of the blue. All weekend long! And then since i mobile deposited my check, NOBODY can cash it! So I’m gonna have to have my job cut me another one so i can have access to MY MONEY! I Was going to close my account with them any ways bc i hate the way they do business. This is ridiculous! You don’t do people like that!! DONT BANK WITH THEM. And if you do, CHANGE BANKS IMMEDIATELY. They can just hold your money until they feel like sending it to you in the mail! I’m so damn mad idk what to do!"
1245,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC has to be the most secure bank in the USA. So secure my loan from a lender that was to be sent via direct deposit to my PNC account, because the Company PLAID didn't pass their strict rules because they are in a tiff with PLAID, the online middle entity that connects the 2 institutions. In effect, my loan expired, I lost my funding for my business start up, and now work for a company whose foundation and operations are similar to the one I had planned. Get real. Your lobbying and  hardheaded power control ""what I say is the way""  attitude cost me a business. What else you offer your customers? Running the gauntlet?  Maybe a bit of raising the draw bridge over the alligator infested moat, whilst I am in the middle of making it across? Hmmm? Thanks PNC! You're a peach!"
1246,1118,PNC Bank,F pnc horrible  bank the worst bank they will steal your debit card and leave you with no access  to your money do not ever use this bank if you want access  to your funds Fu pnc fu you
1247,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been a PNC customer for 20 years. I was never thrilled about the bank, but it has locations everywhere which is very convenient. Recently, my account was hacked. Someone decided to open a Zelle account using their own information at 3AM and deposit all my money in their account. PNC not only let him take the money, they didn't even flag it as suspicious! I tried calling the fraud line for 3 days but couldn't get through. I finally took the day off work and spent 3 hours on the phone getting passed around to incompetent employees. After finally getting a dispute filed, I was told to stop at PNC and open a new account. I went to three different branches just to be told that they didn't have time for me, I would have to schedule an appointment. I work two jobs and go to college, the only time I have during bank hours was the time I had that day from taking off. It's ok though because not only did Truist have time to set me up with an account, they don't have overdraft fees."

1250,1118,PNC Bank,My mortgage just transferred to PNC. So far I'm unimpressed. I'm trying to simply just set up my online account information. I'm now on my third attempt including telephone assistance to set up my account. They told me to call back again in x days. Come on folks no one has time for this. Get your act together. After reading some of the other reviews I would steer clear of this institution. I can't remember having issues on something so simple. This is a red flag.
1251,1118,PNC Bank,"I'm counting the minutes to close my account at this institution, I opened my account about 5 years ago and the first time I needed a personal loan to consolidate my credit cards, they just turned their backs on me.  I believe that the main mission of a bank should be to promote and develop the social well-being of its customers, but you will certainly not find that in PNC, I lost 5 precious years of partnership that were useless, don't waste your time with this bank, when you are in a difficult financial moment, forget it, they will not help you.  And if you make an application in person and they don't give you a positive answer right away, forget it, your application has already been denied and they will leave you waiting for an answer that in fact they already know what it is, stay away from that bank.  My only purpose was to take the pressure off my shoulders and work with more peace of mind and,honestly, paying $460 a month for someone with an annual income of $90k is not a very difficult task, I definitely do not recommend this bank !!!!Fabio Cardoso."

1253,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been a PNC customer for both personal and business banking for over 13 years.I cannot comment on the personal side; On the business side, PNC is beyond reproach. I am quite livid with the degradation of quality of service and ability to execute, especially with their Pinnacle system.A perfect example, and one of many, would be my request to close the pinnacle account.I requested to have it closed 3 weeks ago. I had not heard back from anyone for 2 weeks, so I reached out to (1) ensure the process is being executed and (2) that I would not be charged for the following month's pinnacle system. I was asked to send an email to the individual processing the request last week. Today I find a $163.50 charge for the pinnacle system. Naturally I called the business support at which point the rep confirmed that I should not have been charged but gives me yet another email address to write requesting resolution for the charge.Its a shame because it was a great bank until last year.My accountant suspects PNC is under water and using customer funds to cover their cash flow. At first I thought it was a silly idea but with each interaction I am more convinced she is right. I do hope FRB, FDIC and SEC are going to look into PNC's practices. It seems that they are the BoA of 2022. Fast forward to today,"
1254,1118,PNC Bank,"I would give PNC a NEGATIVE star if it was available. The online system they offer is just garbage! Cannot even see my statement while online. I have to download them to my PC and they have a huge amount of useless information, confusing to read and not giving the account number that is paid to. JUNK service. Stay away from these idiotic morons."
1255,1118,PNC Bank,"They continually decline my credit card, debit card, as well as my internet cash transfers. Worst. Bank. Ever."
1256,1118,PNC Bank,"You’ll only hear from them when they’re selling you something. If you have a problem you’re on your own. I’ve been banking here since 2014. The virtual wallet account/features are fine, but the web based online banking and mobile app lag way behind their competitors and any time I’ve had an issue, their customer support has been nothing more or less than a shoulder to cry on. A few years back they decided to start blocking my acorns investment account round ups from being withdrawn from my checking account. I tried several times to address the issue with customer service but they were no help. Earlier this year I took out an auto loan to buy out my car lease. Honda requires a federal odometer statement to be completed and signed to release the title. PNC should know this, but when I presented that signed paper during my loan appointment I was told it wasn’t needed. I told the loan officer I was certain it was needed and asked that it be included with the check. Fast forward several weeks, PNC title department is blowing up my phone because they haven’t received the title. Meanwhile I’m getting letters from Honda that they haven’t received the  federal odometer statement. It took over a month of PNC calling me (the middle man) about their issue with Honda and the title. Then when Honda finally releases the title, I do the transfer at the NC DMV and I think I’m done. NOPE. A few weeks go by and I get a letter from the DMV stating that PNC is not compliant with an electronic lien holder law enacted in North Carolina in 2016. I’m informed the state will be holding my car title until the issue is resolved. At this time I was buying and remodeling a house so I let it go for a month or so and finally called PNC to inform them of the issue. Spent an hour plus on the phone with customer service. Read the letter several times to the agent who clearly didn’t understand what was I was talking about. They wouldn’t let me talk to the title department because they apparently only make outbound calls. Customer service finally suggested I send a FAX to their title department requesting a call back (stating they also “don’t have email”). So this resourceful millennial figured out how to send them a fax without a land line, without a fax machine but naturally I never heard back from them. After 6 months they finally resolved the issue with the state. As soon as I have a bit of free time I’m transferring all my accounts away from this helpless bank."
1257,1118,PNC Bank,Worst bank ever.  Paid off car loan on time after they acquired account thru a merger with another bank and then they report me as delinquent to the credit bureaus.  Screw you PNC

It is the worst bank in the world"

1260,1118,PNC Bank,Horrible customer service!   I had a zelle sent to me in amount of 1000.  Sender put a note on the transfer which PNC says triggered a fraud alert. My account was frozen and I was told it will be for 30 days.  Meantime I have means of buying my insulin or to pay my rent.  PNC has NEVER contacted me by phone or email.  I found out when my auto pays started being rejected. My savings and checking are both frozen and I can’t get any help.  Can’t wait to get out of this nightmare of a bank.
1261,1118,PNC Bank,"Took out a double mortgage payment without authorization,  would not refund, were extremely rude on the phone and hung up on me when I asked for help."
1262,1118,PNC Bank,I absolutely hate banking with PNC. I have a car loan through them and it’s a nightmare. Their drafts are super delayed and when I do bank drafts online it shows that they’re not even on there. I’ve had multiple double drafts of my car payment and at one point it took 12 weeks to get one of them refunded. It’s always something with them. If you can avoid banking with them do so.
1263,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst bank ever.  They tell you what you want to hear,  even a supervisor. They blame a merchant for a refund pending for 4 days now.  It shows pending in my account still.  Supervisor said it would be available by the end of the day.  Yeah they probably just said that to get me off the phone.  Then if you ever need to use an app like Earnin you can't since they say it is for security reasons.  That's a lie, cause every other bank does.  I think PNC has pathetic security practices but blame it on other companies."
1264,1118,PNC Bank,Another horrible bank. As the Fed raises rates banks are raising their deposit rates on savings and or checking and CD's. Even Citibank is paying 2%. PNC Bank is still paying 0.04% interest on savings unless you have a million dollars and then it goes all the way up to 0.05%. Talk about lack of competitive rates.
1265,1118,PNC Bank,Almost any other bank is better. Keep track of your transactions. They will return your payments instead of holding them until the creditors take them out of your account making you think you have money left when you actually don't in hopes that your account becomes overdrawn. Phone app is down frequently.
1266,1118,PNC Bank,"This is probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Please ignore this bank. You don't want to work with them. I have no idea whether they are trustworthy or dishonest, I only know that our loan processor was completely unresponsive and wouldn't answer her phone, call back, or reply to emails in a timely manner. After two weeks of not getting clarity, I finally had to call a number which took 20 minutes to find and tell them to withdraw my HELOC application."
1267,1118,PNC Bank,Do not use this place.You will regret it.I had BBVA but they sold us out to this sorry place.Please pass this place up
1268,1118,PNC Bank,"Horrible is all that comes to mind. They will lie, cheat and irritate you no matter who you speak to. When you ask them specifically why they did this or that they can’t even answer. Terrible Terrible experience. So glad we got away from this horrible company"
1269,1118,PNC Bank,"Dude… I got this bank when I was a about to get out of highschool, it’s been about 2 years since and this bank has done nothing but irritate me,I do save money n take it out of my acc to store it somewhere more safe. But I do paycheck to paycheck at times.. I just HATEE when I’ll buy something on the 3rd, my bank will say they took out the money for that item.. but on the 10th itll take it out again and sometimes leave me negative a day or two before I get paid I’ve seen other ppl complain about this too. I swear they do it on purpose and I cannot take it anymore they’ve done this more than 5 times and I don’t touch my money when Ik I can’t, I’m not a dummy BUT THEY STILL AWAYS GET ME INTO THE NEGATIVE. i guess these are many red flags, time to bank somewhere else. Pnc sucks 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡"
1270,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC decided to disable cash/check deposits at their branch atms in San Antonio, Texas today, Sunday September 18, 2022.  Now my personal bank account will be overdrawn tomorrow morning(Monday).  Thanks PNC!!  They didn't bother notifying their customers about disabling cash deposits at their atms today.  I am furious about this, and will be closing my account in the morning.    Worst bank I have used my entire 53 years of life.  I hope they fail and go away."
1271,1118,PNC Bank,"My wife and I were working with PNC on a HELOC loan. We both have 740 or higher credit with a dept to income ratio of under 50 and good income, we also invested over 120k in the property over the past 12 months. We started the process on 7/15/2022 and finally decided to use a different lender on 9/08/2022. The reason is because PNC used a drive by appraiser that undervalued our property by at least 115k. When we brought this to PNC’s attention and provided receipts and documentation, it was like pulling teeth to have them set up a new appraisal. When they finally did, it was the same appraisal company, but this time they came into our house. Two weeks later the new appraisal came in 20k less than their 1st appraisal. THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE SINCE WE HAD JUST INVESTED 120k. PNC did not want to loan us what we were requesting so we reached out to another lender, and we are already set to close on 9/22/22. The new lenders appraisal came in at 115k over what PNC had. They were so disturbed by the other appraisal company’s incompetence, that they decided to file a complaint. It took PNC almost 3 months to process a basic HELOC loan with good credit and income, as our new lender completed the process in about 3 weeks. I will never use PNC again!"
1272,1118,PNC Bank,Thee most fascist Chinsiest bank ever for an increase on their visa credit cards.
1273,1118,PNC Bank,"Except for one or two tellers this bank is the worst. My last bad experience among many was trying to purchase a cashiers check with funds from my home equity line of credit for a purchase. The teller actually did not know how to do this transaction nor did the teller next to him. He had to ‘Google’ it within their own computer system I would assume. This was after waiting on line inside the bank with four other customers ahead of me for 35 minutes, I was beyond frustrated and not too happy after waiting, then having untrained and unknowledgeable staff. Between myself, my husband our two children and our small business, we have eight accounts and I’m over it and will be closing them mall. The other terrible reviews speak for themselves."
1274,1118,PNC Bank,One star is too much I have an account that my daughter opened for me due to health issues they have my name and Social Security number attached to the account my daughter has given me a couple of checks in emergency I cashed a $1400 check today …. $30 charge …not the first time… I only have $30000…. When my suit is settled 10s of millions…. I’m getting out of this scam bank …its 2022 u buttheads …. Learn your competition….I don’t need you … this will be seen by egotistical ears… y’all will be humbled in time HARRY R CURNOW 111
1275,1118,PNC Bank,"Without any notice PNC absconded with 2 of my checking account balances of some $6000,, gave no explanation and LIED about sending me the money weeks ago...several attempts with bank managers and representatives have failed to get them to give me my money back...THEFT seems to be a PNC specialty service."
1276,1118,PNC Bank,"Do not use for a Mortgage Loan. The Underwriter makes up their own rules and qualifications for your loan to be approved. You may be told that everything is going well by your loan officer and start paying for things and even have to provide more documents and information, just to make the underwriter happy, even though you provided the information already or who they may need to contact to verify, the Underwriter will decide will on what they want to accept or spend time to verify and will not communicate with the loan officer. We missed our deadline dealing with PNC and their underwriter not accepting a non taxable documented employment with years of documentation. We paid for the appraisal and other needed things a week before the deadline and our loan officer could not get the underwriter to update them on anything causing for their boss to get involved until our loan officer told us that we need to go look elsewhere because the underwriter wasn't going to approve us, even though his boss said all our information and documentation was good. Our loan officer was told prior to us paying for the appraisal that our file was good to go by the Underwriter but a week later, no communication until a few days after the deadline has passed. When brought to PNC about their failures on how this was handled, and requesting compensation for the appraisal, PNC saw not issues with what occurred after doing a ""lengthy"" investigation and refused the request. Getting denied for a loan is part of the game, but lack of communication, being told inconsistent information and even being told by the company's loan officer to go look at another company and apologizing for how the Underwriter handled our file, are all red flags as to why you should not use PNC for a mortgage loan."
1277,1118,PNC Bank,I worked for PNC for 17 years until my job was eliminated. My husband passed recently from prostate cancer. I have done my best to pay all bills before the due date and my payment history will reflect that. Paid 3x the minimum due. Having more heartbreak due to the loss of both our dogs as well. Cannot believe the way I was treated for paying 3x the minimum due not even 24 hrs after due date. Will take all assets with PNC elsewhere. Way to go pnc!!  I’m am embarrassed that I trusted you with my $ for this long. I will pass your heartless treatment to anyone and everyone I know!!  Aren’t people going through enough?? I’m so ashamed of PNC!!
1278,1118,PNC Bank,I am closing my account of 20+ years after learning the manager of the branch Emilee Westendorf manager at Vandalia Ohio has been sleeping with my husband during work hours for over a year. Not blaming her for the affair but to get paid to ruin my families life - I’m not ok with that . I will not trust my money at a bank that pays their managers to engage in this behavior.
1279,1118,PNC Bank,Bad bad bad bad bad Bad bad bad bad bad
1280,1118,PNC Bank,I will never use this bank again. I had a credit card throught them and they just reduce my credit limit with no notice and then want to charge me overdraft fees. Worst credit card bak ever existed. Do not get a credit card through this crooked bank.
1281,1118,PNC Bank,"Paid my monthly Visa online of $50.  PNC deducted the $50 from my checking account, which is with another bank, and then deducted $50 again. They admitted their mistake. Instead of putting the month back into my other Visa, which is my check account, they said they would send a check within 7 to 10 days. Why did I have to wait for 10 days for them to mail a check and then deal with a screwed up post office to wait for the check. They made the mistake. Why do I have to wait to get my money back. I originally had my checking and savings with PNC but then could not account or a missing $589, of which they had no interest in helping with this loss. My balance is low enough now not to use the card any more. I feel sorry for the people who for this bank but the complaints are not about  brick and mortar. They are about the people who work for the bank."
1282,1118,PNC Bank,I can't rate any lower. Or I would.
1283,1118,PNC Bank,Had this account for 16 years until PNC bought the bank and never had fees.  Now PNC is stealing the money that I had in the account.  They should be put in jail for theft.  No reason to take something that doesn't belong to them.
1284,1118,PNC Bank,"I really appreciate you all ,may good ness and messy be with you all day"
1285,1118,PNC Bank,They are the worst bank ive ever had. They allowed my money to be stolen and used for someones sony playstations account. Super easy to track. Yet they cant resolve the issue. I just got a nice raise at work and will be closing my account next week going to a much more professional outfit.
1286,1118,PNC Bank,Banks online system doesn't work!!!!  Press 1 or 2.  I tried over and over then u get a are you there?    System is a joke!!! Switching to Chase!!!
1287,1118,PNC Bank,"I would give zero stars if I could. I deposited cash at a bank location atm at 930pm and the machine ate the cash and turned off. The deposit was never made into my account, provisional credit is not granted by pnc until up 10 business days, 1 to 2 when expedited. This was cash my parents gave me to order my daughters birthday gift, their is nothing else PNC can do nor are you able to talk to anyone above James Trotter. No 24hr customer service, and an outside company who deals with the atms. This is very inconvenient to customers. I will be closing all accounts with this bank including a very substantial estate account. I rather do business with a bank who can work with me as a customer."
1288,1118,PNC Bank,"This is a very unprofessional bank, terrible service, really bad service. Their website is very poor, their own employees do not understand it. There is no way this bank should be allow to operate. They promised to fix several problema we had with our business account and never even responded. Terrible bank."
1289,1118,PNC Bank,Banks vary depending on location and staff. Edinburgh indiana and kankakee il are awful. Skokie is great
1290,1118,PNC Bank,"I gave them one star because I can’t give them minus 10. We were customers of BBVA (personal, business, loans, credit cards, etc.) and we ended up taking our accounts to another bank because since PNC took over it’s been chaos. Their customer service is deplorable and after months of going back and forth they simply gave up on our complaint and now we end up with outrageous unjustified charges. Worst banking experience ever.Don’t expect the BBB to help resolve your complaints. PNC isn’t even accredited by the BBB so it’s a waste of your time. BBB reserves the right to modify the reviews and they will publish a review in my name that has nothing to do with our complaint, ignoring our arguments and siding up with PNC.Para los hispanos... no se dejen engañar por la publicidad, realmente no tienen servicio en español."
1291,1118,PNC Bank,"This is the absolutely WORST BANK in the WORLD!!! I was unfortunately forced to come to this bank after BBVA sold the bank to them. I have had nothing but problems since. I have had 3 faudulent transactions on my account since my beginning with this Bank! I contacted the fraud department each time with absolutely NOTHING done! The first one was a fraudulent lawyer who took $1,000.00 from me and then I never heard from him again! After their “investigation “ they took the grand back out and never told me WHY they decided to side with this crook! I never received a confirmation letter stating any reason why they decided to go against me. I have since had 2 other issues which the last one I cleared up myself. I’ve lost over $4,000.00 because this bank does absolutely NOTHING to resolve anything!! I’ve also had a customer service agent flip out on me for just wanting answers. I would trust the Mob with my money faster than this Company! Please don’t keep your money in this bank! I got threatening emails because my account was overdrawn from this last fraudulent issue and in spite of them knowing about it, (the overdraft was -$1.12) they sent me threatening emails and tried to get me to stop payment on my last payment for this lousy $1.12!! They do NOT care about the customer. This is obvious! I took all of my money out of the bank and only put what I absolutely need to put in until I get another bank!! I have also attempted to contact headquarters. If they don’t contact you the first time you never hear from them again!! I do NOT recommend this bank under any circumstances!!!"
1292,1118,PNC Bank,"This is the worst bank in the world! My account was hacked so I received two phone calls from the fraud dept…..both asked me for pin or password…not given. One was an actual person from fraud dept! Acct was put on hold but allowing 3 payments to go through. They didn’t go through and I was charged for them. They wouldn’t let me transfer money to a new bank, even being in the bank and going through a few people on the phone. I was hacked 3 times in 3 months since I was with them. Their telephone people are horrible! No one knows what they are doing! They make false promises! DO NOT USE THIS BANK!"
1293,1118,PNC Bank,They was extremely rude and highly unprofessional and asked questions that was not necessary and the women refused to cash a check because she did not want to give me my money and the people behind the counter was laughing at me this was the pnc bank located in Pickerington ohio next to the giant eagle store
1294,1118,PNC Bank,This bank is terrible every since PNC took over i havent been able to sign into the app and also i had a secured credit card that was turned into a credit which means i am stuck at that limit unless i qualify and also they dont offer any services to small business that dont qualify them outside of finanicing ....Terrible Service
1295,1118,PNC Bank,"What I'm about to tell you is , to be quite frank, unbelievable. I don't blame you for casting doubt on my story but I assure you it is all true and verifiable because the branch called the police and I'm sure there is a record. As I write this it is Sunday afternoon. I am sitting in what is my new lodgings which happens to be a blue port a potty on an abandoned job site. It is raining. I have not eaten since noon Friday. My water ran out last night. When my truck was impounded they allowed me to get what I could carry but nothing could be left on the side of the road so all my possessions left as well. I am 1,000 miles from home. I was a normal , responsible person with employment and I considered myself an asset to society as a whole. That all changed at 5:30pm Friday afternoon at a PNC branch near Cincinnati when I put my ATM card in their machine which promptly confiscated it. I went inside to inform them of the problem to which their answer was ""Call your bank"". They informed me that although the ATM is on their property, has their logo on it and they do business with it that they don't own or have any control over it. My bank will not mail a new card to me because my residence at the time was a hotel as I was out of my area working. At this point PNC bank had left me destitute. You had taken the only access to my finances. Saturday after opening I went back to the branch to seek help. My rent was due. I was low on fuel and had not eaten in almost 24 hours.( At 48 hours the pains seem to subside but the longings for food does not) I had found a checkbook and re-entered the branch, after talking to my bank who gave me several options , I was pleading for help. I was adamant about presenting solutions to the scenario which came about as soon as your ATM took my card. I offered several solutions but was rejected to the offer! At this point I could tell they were done with me and that's when the police arrived. To shorten this story , mainly to conserve battery , let's jump to Saturday night. Since I could not pay room rent I packed my belongings in my truck and tried to get to my jobsite but ran out of fuel before I got there. Last night when the police arrived to investigate why I was there . I told them the story so far and that I was out of fuel and waiting on tomorrow to try to seek a remedy as I was now destitute and homeless because of PNC bank. I don't think they believed my story. Why shoud they? It sounds like a made up sob story and I am going thru it.  I don't think whoever reads this can ever fully understand or appreciate the shame of being penniless and homeless with no options. Where at every point help was available but refused solely because when we normal people see a begger or homeless we think I did it why can't they? What's wrong with them for being poor?I've been broke and homeless for a day now and I tear up at my attitude towards the less fortunate. I understand the shame of having nothing. I see the look in people's eye when they regard me. Asking for help, Telling a wild story of how ""Really, it's not my fault. I have money I just can't get to it right now"". I will thank PNC bank for one thing. You have opened my eyes to how close we ALL are to reverting to our animal instincts.  I will be drinking river water soon.I have not gone thru the dumpster yet but I fear it is in my future. I'm mainly hopping to find shelter material but some canned goods would be welcomed. I can bash it on the rock and drink whats inside if I find something.  Have you ever thought about how to open a can without an opener? I have.It's Sunday now. I hope to have better living arrangements by tonight because you can't really sleep sitting up in a port a potty I've found . At best you get a few naps in. So here we are ....     I'm broke,homelss, no vehicleHungry and hiding out like a criminal on old job site  I have no way of accessing g my funds. I was refused all help at the branch then you called the police to tell me I can't even sit in your lot while I figure this out  You have ruined my life. You have stolen my access to life's necessities with no apology or compassion. I have money. I have checks. In today's world I cannot believe such a simple thing has cost me so much. You had the chance to remedy the situation instead you chose to distance yourself from your responsibilities. Your actions have left me in a situation I may not survive all because your machine ate my card. What small things turn the wheel of life against you instead of for you.Monday...Daylight If you think you won't kill to survive,  your wrong. When faced with starvation the human animal will go to very drastic measures to continue life.5hats all it is. The single , sole very basic need to eat takes over. You don't think 'will it be missed?'does it have a family? The hunter comes out. The wind takes on a thickness you have never felt before. The snap of a twig sounds like a gunshot. After the kill is when the work"
1296,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could give it less than 1 star I would. They let me know at 9:30 pm that they were not putting through a transfer that was going to my PNC credit card. Money was there, but through their negligence, their PNC credit card had charged me a late fee. Credit card customer was rude and unwilling to remove fee!"
1297,1118,PNC Bank,I was a customer for 4 years and I recently lost my prepaid debit card. I called for a new card and changed my address. I was giving to option of 7 to 10 business days or 3 business days. I chose to get it in 3 business days and pay the fee. Because of me choosing 3 days my card was suspended. I reached out to Pnc fraud protection and someone was suppose to get back to me. For 2 weeks I was able to get my money off my card at the teller window. Yesterday I was informed my account was closed due to me not providing documentation in a timely manner. I work 6 to 6 . So on my day off I provided the documentation but it was too late. My bill are paid with my account and now I don’t have any way of paying my bills. Because my pay check was sent back to my job. Which will take 3 business days for them to process. Thank you Pnc for not doing your job
1298,1118,PNC Bank,"Absolutely wonderful people associated with the bank on rt57 in Hackettstown,NJ, Caring, efficient, friendly, and knowledgable"
1299,1118,PNC Bank,"After  more than three weeks of trying to get the rewards percentages resolved we have not moved  any more Forward than where we already were. Out of all of the pages that show every transaction that has been made we were only able to get three pages that showed the actual percentage. Lucy the branch manager has tried to get corporate to get this information to us so we could get this resolved but has had no luck. Corporate did call me the day before yesterday and left a voicemail. I tried returning Angela‘s phone number I left a message I did not receive a return call I called approximately an hour and a half later and still have not received a return phone call from her.  Phone call again with no answer. I pay my statement balance every month, which is my actual balance now because I do not carry over a balance from previous months. I Went yesterday and paid off the balance, at the PNC branch on Jefferson as it was going to be due on the 20th and I did not want to take a chance of this dragging on to where for some reason the payment wouldn’t be able to be made on time. What I thought was going to be a situation that Could get solved fairly quickly, especially after meeting Lucy face-to-face as she is the branch manager, and  Angela from corporate. For some reason, we could not get the documents we needed to go over and see where mistakes have been made, one way or the other. After waiting three more days with no appointments, no explanations. I went yesterday and paid the balance on my account off $1471.25 .I will be adding this to my original complaint, as I don’t feel this will ever get resolved.Draw your own conclusion, that if I was an individual that had hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank or even millions, would it have taken over three weeks to get this resolved? I think not.In closing I would like to acknowledge that Lucy the branch manager has always been polite and professional with me and I felt she wanted to get it resolved as much as I did. I only talk to Angela twice she assured me that they were going to take care of this and that they were on it, but nothing ever got done.Maybe after reading this you can make your own decision about doing business with this lending institution."
1300,1118,PNC Bank,"Hello, I have used a few banks, however, PNC Bank I feel is one of the best. Their whole team is there to help you, regardless of what you may need, The customer service at the Taylor location I feel is outstanding. You could not ask for a better banking experience."
1301,1118,PNC Bank,Predatory Lending! Consumer BEWARE. We got a 100K HELOC at a fixed rate and they snuck and split it into two 80K at the agreed fixed rate and 20K at a variable! This was trickery on  GRAND scale. Will not fix their scam and we are now stuck with a loan we were tricked into.  RUN AWAY FROM THIS BANK!
1302,1118,PNC Bank,I was TRIPLE CHARGED for a chantico's fire. The rascals absconded with my hard-earned canes money and locked my card on top of it!!! This isn't the first time either!! They did the same when I attempted to purchase a dashing gut knife lore. Now I have to get into contact with my mother so she can reason with the rubbish tellers to unlock my card!
1303,1118,PNC Bank,PNC is the WORST BANK EVER.  PLEASE RUN.  THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.  I AM MOVING ALL OF MY MONEY FROM THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1304,1118,PNC Bank,"I went to my IOLTA account online.  BBCA was the best with IOLTA.  Now PNC has completely destroyed any reputation of being customer friendly.  You cant move any money from IOLTA to another account without going into a bank in person.  Then PNC starts Pinnacle to allow online transfers.  After calling into Pinnacle, the customer service rep asked me for by business ID# and operator #.  Those are clearly PNC specific database numbers.  Why would PNC be asking me for this?  I am moving to a new bank immediately and taking all my accounts with me."
1305,1118,PNC Bank,God help anyone today who is a POA.  They want everything done in person.  Even when you do they don't do their work.  Spent over 4 hrs and they didn't even put the POA in their system.  All this for an address change.  Too bad management will not hear what needs to change.  Apparently they make too much to care.
1306,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC formerly NCB, has to be one of the worst banks in terms of customer service. Their moto should be WE DO NOT RETURN PHONE CALLS. Not the assistant manager, nor the Reginal manager. Put your money somewhere else. How many phone calls does it take to fix a problem. In my case, 2 weeks and counting. Worst of all, NOT a single phone call from their part."
1307,1118,PNC Bank,"I just finished speaking with customer service at PNC. I was a BBVA customer and since PNC took over I have not had a reason to speak with anyone. I called online banking and was transferred  to customer service. The young woman I was talking with about enrolling in online banking was rude. I did not have a pin for my card I had had the account for 10 years but had never used the pin. Also,  I did not have an ID pin given to me when I setup the account because I never setup an account with PNC. I answered many questions to show that the account that I wanted to enroll in online banking was mine. I was eventually informed that I would need one of those pins to enroll in online banking. However, the customer  service persons voice was getting louder and had a negative tone. She could have just said initially "" I'm sorry but I will not be able to enroll you in online banking today the card pin is required. I can send you one in the mail which you should receive in 3-5 days. She sounded annoyed that I did not have a card pin, did not have an ID pin and that I was not aware of those facts. She had asked earlier on if I wanted a pin and I said no I just want to enroll in online banking. I did not know that I had to have a card pin to enroll in online banking. I have only ever used a card pin for cash withdrawals which I have not done in the last 25 years. Also, I have had many online banking accounts and if you can provide enough information customer service has always been able to help.  I have never had to have a card pin to enroll in online banking. I was already enrolled in online banking through BBVA and the account was about 9-10 years old. So maybe using a pin is a good idea, but pardon me for not knowing that  it was required. I have been asked many questions over the years but never have I had to have a card pin. When I told the customer  service agent that she had an unpleasant attitude she was even more unpleasant. I can only imagine my distress if had I been calling about a serious banking concern. I told her that I had been a customer at BBVA. My first experience with PNC was today, a bank that I had never even heard of until they took over BBVA. What an unpleasant first and probably last experience."
1308,1118,PNC Bank,BBVA had an award-winning app! And now I'm working with a company that barely has an app. I do my business overnight and this is when I need to move money... this is when I need to bank. Just about every other day they have scheduled maintenance for the f#*&$ing app as well as the online portal. If only I could use one of the sites I would be able to manage but they shut both the app and online banking down at the same time and I am so frustrated and I am just done with this bank. I am going somewhere else.

With that being said, I applied for a loan with a 773 credit score a week ago and still haven't got a response. It shouldn't take more then an hour. Today I said forget it and applied for a loan from discover and was approved in 10 mins. I will never recommend pnc"
1311,1118,PNC Bank,I applied and received a checking and savings acct with pnc .The customer service is terrible .the call wait time and online access is also nit very good.i was really dissapointed
1312,1118,PNC Bank,"I don’t bank with PNC but I have my car loan through this bank and every month it withdraws my car payment from my checking account automatically. Well, what I assume to be a computer error led to PNC withdrawing my monthly payment FOUR TIMES in one day — more than $1,400 — plunging my bank account into the negatives. I tried calling, but the voice banking wouldn’t work and there doesn’t seem to be another way to get through. I tried messaging, but the webpage would crash every time I tried. Finally, I went to a PNC branch to solve the issue and the manager was incredibly rude. He talked down to me the whole time and basically insisted I was lying, until I showed him my bank app with the multiple transactions. He then said there was nothing PNC could do. (Fortunately, my bank was able to dispute the claim, and also refunded me the overdraft fee I incurred because of PNC’s error.) I’ll be refinancing my car loan with a different bank after this experience. Would give 0 stars if I could."
1313,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could give 0 stars I would do so in a heartbeat.  I have tried to cash a check from my mother's estate that is drawn on PNC and they have twice refused - the first because the signature allegedly didn't match and the second was refused as a mobile deposit that they then would not cash in person either.  So no, after having been charged a returned check fee for a signature they didn't like and denying to allow a mobile deposit or to cash it, I have to request a THIRD check be issued and then I have to go back into the branch (where I wasted an hour today) and beg them to cash this check. I am beginning to understand why people bury their money in the backyard instead of using banks."
1314,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bank as a company are pretty lousy. I opened an account when I moved to Georgia in 2015. The Palmetto branch is well run, but PNC corporate has many drawbacks. I had my account go negative a few years ago when my wife died and a month later Social Security debited her last benefit check back... typical government. The local branch worked it out with me but otherwise I would have been hit with fees for 4 days (PNC charges, or used to charge, a recurring fee for the first 4 days your account is negative whether any new transactions have gone through or not.) Second, I tried to get my house refinanced to fix my septic tank and PNC was there for every step, calls each day to update me until they decided that they would not do the refinancing. One day I stopped hearing from them until I got the form letter a week and a half later that they would not be doing the refinancing... basically they talked to me until they decided that they would not do my refinancing (and get the interest payments for it) and then I was not worth talking to or emailing. The final straw was this spring. I had a house in another state that I finally got to sell. I needed a form notarized since it was a cash sale. I went into the local branch (they have a notary, I know because I had called) to get it notarized and was told that they only notarize real estate that is done through PNC. So I had to find another notary and pay to get it done even though I had been a PNC customer for years and had never missed any payments to anybody or bounced any checks. Again, the local branch is great but PNC corporate seems to me to be all about makibg the money and, in a choice between making some more money and customer service, the customer will always lose."
1315,1118,PNC Bank,"While I have not been happy with the 800 number customer service or the format of the monthly statement as compared to the old BBVA statement I would like to give the above rating to an employee, Pamela Donaldson, at the branch bank in Killeen, Texas.  She has been very courteous and helpful in assisting our moving some funds around.  The bank is well represented by her manner and abilities."
1316,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst bank.  Charter should be revoked.  They acquired BBVA and didn't give me access to my account for 3 months. 3 months!  No one could figure it out.  My dog is smarter.  Their technology is terrible.  Their people are terrible.  Their branches are terrible and they keep closing them.  Online access gets revoked randomly, fees for atm balance check.  Its like this bank is from the 1980s.  MORONS"
1317,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst bank ever. Try to run a business but 1 roll of Quarters a day!!!! Yesterday tryed to buy 200.00 ones, said they did not have. Never been treated this way ever. I will be leaving."
1318,1118,PNC Bank,"The credit card division is the worst I have ever worked with. DO NOT USE THEM.  They make egregious errors in the handling of your account, will not acknowledge their mistakes, and may ultimately decimate your credit score."
1319,1118,PNC Bank,"Yes, another unwilling victim of the BBVA buyout. They bought my mortgage and then stated adding fees and charges. Last one was for $1500 for some transaction they initiated while they were supposedly fixing another error they made on my account.RUN don't walk away from POS institution."
1320,1118,PNC Bank,The App cannot be accessed / used on your device about 40% of the time. Super glitchy.I regret joining PNC.Michelle Loomis
1321,1118,PNC Bank,"My biggest complaint is that transactions on their end are so slow to process, and I never truly know how much money I have. Twice I have been overdrawn suddenly , after just seeing that I have money available. The app is too confusing and slow. I never had any problems like this when we were BBVA Bank."
1322,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could leave PNC with less than 1 star I totally would. I’ve been with this bank for years now and I honestly don’t know why because my family and I have had nothing but problems and gone into financial issues because of them. I’ve had one helpful lady who spoke clear English in all the countless times I’ve called to speak to their customer service. They have other nice people that work there but I don’t know if they realize I just nod along to things they say because I can’t understand them. I think they do it that way to lower the number of calls made to their CS dept. but it would still be nice to not have to be on the phone for an hour because I need everything repeated. But even after calling them three times over the last two weeks, I still don’t have a debit card. They told me it would arrive in the mail earlier this week, and it’s now the weekend and I was told by another PNC member just this morning that the order for my new debit card is nonexistent. I’ve been without a means to pay for anything for like three weeks now. The money in my old checking account was hacked into and stolen. I know better than to use debit cards now, but having one just in case would be nice. I was told my social security number is wrong by several PNC members. I can’t send money through Zelle either right now because my ATM pin does not work. I can’t use my bank account in Venmo because I have no means of verifying my account. And of course banks are only open like 3 days a year so I have to wait another while before going in for more help. I actually just got a Discover card for the time being so I can afford to eat and have a roof over my head. Oh and don’t get me started on PNC randomly cancelling access to all my accounts for no reason. That’s a fun one. And the worst part is, this happens ALL the time. I’m so lost with this bank, I don’t know why it’s so bad and I know it’s sort of known to be the “bad bank” too. It just sounds like such a hassle to switch banks."
1323,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC Bank Arlington, Texas.  The worst banking experience EVER--froze me out of my account for a week without any notice to me--leaving me scrambling to pay my rent that I had scheduled to be paid through my PNC Account.  I am NOT talking about a check hold.  This money had been in my account for a month and a half.  They still have not returned all my money.  I opened a new account with PNC Bank in June 2022 after I moved to a different area, with a cashier's check and two $100 money orders.  They could not be bothered to call the issuing bank for the check until the next day.  And made a big stupid deal about whether I could open a new account with a cashier's check.  ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?  The check was cleared the next day, but they put an extended hold on the $100 money orders--which I thought was crazy.  They had been fooled by a money order before they said.  I thought that was the point of using a money order that it is as good as cash-apparently not.  But the real crazy was yet to come.  I made additional deposits over the next month.On Sunday, July 31 paid my rent online with my PNC account.  On Monday, August 1, 2022, I got a low balance email alert from my PNC Bank account. I looked on my account and it showed I had money but said $0 ""available"" balance.  I called CS and she (dumb) said the bank had decided ""they did not want a relationship with me"", but would send me my money in TWO WEEKS by mailing me a cashier's check for my money.  What about the rent that's due now?  I asked for her supervisor (dumber).  He didn't know anything.  He gave me apparently the wrong phone number to ""account closure"". I called ""account closure"" and their answering machine said it was the ""check fraud"" department and if I left a message they were not the right department they would not call back.  What you cannot bother to call a customer back to re-direct my call?  Apparently not b/c they never called me back.  I called and emailed the Arlington, TX PNC Branch repeatedly.  The woman who I spoke with, Betty, had set up my account in the first place.  I told her I wanted my money NOW.  She lied and said they had already mailed the casher's check to me.  I asked by certified mail?  She didn't know.  She told me her manager's name, Adrian and he would call me back.  But he didn't call me that day.  I asked her for the manager's manager/director's number.  She refused to give it to me.  She said I had to go through channels. I told her for that to work the manager had to call me back.  In the meantime I'm scrambling to pay my bills and rent with no access to my funds, after incurring a NSF fee when PNC Bank did not honor my rent payment and I incurred a $42 FedEx fee to overnight a rent check from another account to the leasing office.  I spoke with PNC Branch Manager Adrian on Wednesday or Thursday  and he was going to look into it.  Crickets.  On Friday we spoke and he said I could come pick up a cashier's check for my money.  He didn't say what changed or why I couldn't get my money from Monday to Friday up to that point, despite my repeated demands, and now I could.  What happened?   He said that PNC had probably sent me a letter explaining.  I told him NO, PNC Bank hadn't sent me ANYTHING and the only way I knew they had frozen my account was a low balance alert I had set up.  Adrian said they were holding $1,000 for a mobile deposit I had made on July 11.  I asked why, he said they were holding it for 5 business days.  I asked him if he was aware that today was August 5th, and his explanation made no sense.  5 business days had long since passed.  I walk into the bank Friday to get my check and Betty says, oh they decided they will keep your account open.... after ALL THAT.  I asked her who in their right mind would continue to do business with PNC Bank?   I got all my money out of my account except that $1,000.  I am still waiting to see what lies I will hear and hoops I have to jump through to get the last of my funds out of the grasp of PNC Bank.  I asked Adrian why they were holding my $1,000.  He said he didn't know but once I got it I would have to go back up to the PNC Branch to close my account to keep from accruing fees.  I hate them so much right now.I suggest anyone even considering using PNC Bank to run, RUN, unless you want them to freeze access to your money, without notice to you, for a week at a time, bounce your rent payments, and keep portions of your funds indefinitely without explanation.  Outrageous!   It appears that PNC Bank's security is so lacking, and they have been fooled so much, that they will put everyday customers like myself through hell to the point that it frustrates the whole point of having a demand account.  If you cannot pay me my money on demand, and you make my payments for my obligations late as a result, what good are you as a bank?  NONE."
1324,1118,PNC Bank,By far one of the worst banks to work with. They have maintenance to systems almost every other day. Customer service is even worst. I definitely look forward to switching soon.
1325,1118,PNC Bank,"One of the worst bank ever in the world 🌍 this bank is seems to be horrible bank I ever seen, this bank  everything bad nothing make you interested with this bank, bbva was better thousand time than this bank, before they switch to pnc, nothing on this bank is good at all, horrible bank, horrible customer service, horrible app, this bank should be garbage of the world."
1326,1118,PNC Bank,"Video banking instead of actual people at drive through, I understand the option for those with hours that don’t allow them to do their banking any other way but to make all others suffer because of this is BAD customer relations . I and many I know in my town are looking into other banking institutes."
1327,1118,PNC Bank,This banking corporation is horrible and we will never deal with them ever again. My husband has been with them for over 10 year and their fraud department is just as bad. We have papers with fraudulent signatures and all and they allowed this all to go on with deposits and withdrawals and we have no idea how whoever it was even got ahold of our bank information to even get into our account and they have done nothing about this but put it against us. They took my husbands whole check knowing this is going on and used it for the negative the fraudulent people caused and won’t give it back so seeing how they want to play and we have the evidence we have they will be in contact with an attorney and they will pay it all back and they will pay the fees of the attorney. Seriously don’t waste your time with this bank they are very untrusting and don’t care about their clients it’s disgusting what we are going through but we are going to turn this right back around on them. Don’t open anything with them cause your not protected they lie and we will never bank with this bank again….
1328,1118,PNC Bank,"Another victim of BBVA buy out. Horrible experience. It was a struggle to get access to my account.  Been waiting a year for a pin to my debit card. First rep told me they don't send it and you have to go to a branch.  Finally agreed to send it but was never received.  Next rep said they usually send it and could expedite it for $25. When I pressed to have it expedited for free, her manager told me they don't expedite mailing pins.  Finally got to a branch today and the woman said it should be the same pin as I have with BBVA.  Nice reps but they make it up as they go along.  Forget about calling, the IVR wants every detail of your life and frequently just hangs up or doesn't recognize button pushes/words.  Stay away."
1329,1118,PNC Bank,0 stars. Worst banking experience. I was with compass not PNC! Most greedy company I’ve ever dealt with period. Avoid PNC they do not care about their customers. All they want is money and step on you to get it!
1330,1118,PNC Bank,I wish I was able to give this Bank a negative score but I have to choose a one as the lowest I wouldn't recommend this Bank to a person that only had a dollar to deposit let alone anything over a hundred they'll keep your money whenever they decide especially when you make big transactions like paying for a funeral. When I made an appointment with a banker I was telling her about my situation and how I was trying to pay for my son's funeral then she's going to tell me we not going to have this conversation in this Bank don't talk about what's going on in this bank we don't want to hear that okay so now not only are you taking my money but you're censoring my conversations as well thanks PNC Bank for nothing. And don't worry I plan on posting these reviews on all social media platforms as well as any platforms containing to reviews for PNC bank until I get my money. And mind you I deposited my income tax refund
1331,1118,PNC Bank,"The bank branch in Plum Pa is one to stay away from.  I live out of state and after speaking to the teller regarding cashing a check I sent my daughter for an emergency, she refused to cash it.  I have 3 times the amount in my account and she got great enjoyment humiliating my daughter!  I will never step foot in that branch again.  I am filing an official complaint with the bank regarding her actions along with the prejudice attitude she had towards my daughter.  Such a disgrace to have someone so evil working with the public.  She needs a job with ZERO interaction with people."
1332,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bank did it again. I received deposits from the woman who purchased my house in Maine. I then had a PNC rep call me and question the deposits, which I explained. Then I received deposits again this morning and it showed a $2400 balance in my account as I had $900 already in the account and another $1,400 kicked in. I then transferred $1,300 into my savings acct at PNC and a few hours later I get a low threshold alert of $0 in every account leaving me with no money for the weekend. I then called and the bank explained that all my transactions were now pending with a $0 balance in all accounts and quite possibly it would be cleared by Monday. So I told them to cancel my transfer so at least I'd have the $900 back in my account and they refused to. What is the most idiotic thing is the fact that the transfer wasn't from an external bank but from the same bank from checking to savings and they still placed a hold on funds that actually existed and were not from a pending deposit. At the very least they should have credited the $900 which was clear and held off in the remainder."
1333,1118,PNC Bank,"I’m a legacy BBVA customer that was forced to join PNC bank, and it has been an absolute nightmare. During the migration, customer service had no clue what was going on and could not answer questions. Then, after the launch occurred, trying to get in touch with a live human was almost impossible (the mobile app at least allowed you to “chat”, but the answers from their agents were scripted). Now, if / when I call to try to get help, they simply want to pacify you with what little information that can share and then pawn you off to another dept or push you to the website to get help. I had to file a dispute with them regarding an erroneous payment I made to the wrong doctor and it has been months since I asked for help. I sent them all the info and documentation they asked for, but no word on status, no communication at all. When I call, they say it will a being handled and that I’ll get a letter or something, but refuse to put me through to anyone.  Strangely, in the past few weeks, I’ve received numerous messages from “customer experience” reps saying that are following up on my dispute l, but when I talk to them they ask for a lot of w personal info the bank should know, so now I’m suspicious of phishing. They are a mess! They owe me $344.97 for the billI I wrong accidentally paid to the wrong doc, and they have my digital receipt + proof in there system I made the payment, so I don’t know why they don’t just tell the doctor who took my money to pay me my refund!!!"
1334,1118,PNC Bank,"The customer service is the worst one I have ever received! First I spoke with a woman she was trying to finish the call without helping me, I called in 2 hours and I spoke with 3 persons, but nobody helped me. I cannot enter in the bank application and they don’t have the decision. I do not recommend this bank!"
1335,1118,PNC Bank,"The most worsted fng bank in the world!!!! Most sack of it bank in CORPUS CHRISTI, TX ON AYERS!!!!!  CKING  MAGGOTS MANAGER, DON'T KNOW THE FK BETWEEN A DOLLAR BILL AND A FUNG QUEER ASS QUARTERS!!!!@ the teller play grab ass WITH Each other's!!! No WONDER  THAT'S HIT EATING BARD BANCH IS CLOSING FING BANKS!!!! TRYING TO ORGANIZE  PEOPLE TO BOYCOTT THAT AYERS BANK !!! LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE U ASLES!!!!! BUT LOOK AT THE NUMBERS"
1336,1118,PNC Bank,If I could give a no star review I would. The customers service for the app and online banking is garbage. The app is often down or buggy. I loose access to my account online regularly. The activity takes days to a week to show up in the online register. I was told as a solution to keep a paper register. The doesn’t solve the issue of time sensitive transactions. I will be finding a new financial institution to do my personal banking.
1337,1118,PNC Bank,Everything was great until someone remotely stole 600.00$ out on my account and PNC has not helped me at all. Totally unacceptable! They keep giving me the excuse they're taking care of it but have done absolutely nothing! Why would someone want an account with PNC if people can steal your money? This is not acceptable!
1338,1118,PNC Bank,"They do not block overdraft attempts, even though there is no money in account. Unfortunately my hard earned check is now gone to fees for having an overdrawn account and I lost an entire first check. They claim they cant do anything about it, but last time this happened (an attempt) they were able to reverse it so I am unsure what the reality is at this bank. It seems they dont have set policies, tellers and customer service will simply do what they like based on how they feel. Very unprofessional service... I wish I had a good thing to post but since they stopped being BBVA they basically suck."
1339,1118,PNC Bank,"Former BBVA customer and PNC victim here. If you have a choice, avoid this bank like the plague. You WILL NOT have a good experience. Customer service is non-existent, their phone system would even have you believe no humans work there. Their app is trash and is literally down more than up. Forget about using a PNC credit card, every other transaction will be declined for fraud. One day I could buy groceries, the next I'd have to use a different card. After many attempts, I finally got a moron to look into it and was told there's nothing that can be done to adjust the fraud algorithm. I had no choice in coming to this dysfunctional mess of a bank, but I did have a choice to leave it. I'd suggest every victim associated with them do the same."
1340,1118,PNC Bank,PNC is only good if you own a mega corporations. They do not care otherwise.
1341,1118,PNC Bank,"It's been months and they still can't figure out how to get my mobile app to take deposit checks. It keeps crashing and they do nothing about it, don't call me back or anything. Now, they are duplicating charges and claim it must be on the merchant side. Really? Never happened before and now 2 different merchants in the same day? I verified online that they only took 1 w/d each. PNC AGAIN REFUSES TO HELP! And they keep closing branches so it's difficult to get in somewhere to talk to a real person and not a bot."
1342,1118,PNC Bank,"What a horrible HORRIBLE bank!  And people who work there that have zero customer service!   I am the POA for my mother and dropped off my legal documents to get on her account and I was told legal review would take 2-5 days.  Had to make many calls to find out what was happening to this simple task.  “Dawn” a so/called banker at the Branch in Kettering, OH, doubt she has any education to be in this position, had my paperwork on her desk all this time and certainly no communication skills. with nothing done on it. It is now 22 days later and finally I come in to sign the signature card and she has put a capital letter in the middle of my last name.  She says that is the way it looked to her on a note when I left the paperwork.  So paperwork had to be redone. I asked why didn’t you check the my name on the legal paperwork I brought in?  Silence. I could go on and on with this person and her rudeness and the totally broken system then have, which centers around having to make appointments and wait for days/weeks to be helped or leaving messages that don’t get returned ever!  Writing the President of the bank and cancelling account."
1343,1118,PNC Bank,"I don’t even know where to start. This is by far the worst fücking bank on the face of the planet. I don’t get paid on time because of this bank, I’ve been behind on bills because I’ve had to wait 3+ days to get my paycheck and none of my other coworkers had this issue with they’re banks. And I don’t know why PNC is so prideful about theyre app. Half of the time the damn thing is “down for maintenance”. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been low on money and not been able to get things I need because I can’t check my account balance. Not to mention the constant spam in emails for useless sh!t or the useless things I get in the mail; IM NOT APPLYING FOR A FUČKING STUDENT LOAN. Fūck this bank. Fuçk PNC. It’s the most fûcking retârded bank ever and I hope every single PNC Bank gets blown the fučk up. FUÇK YOU PNC TANT"
1344,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bank claimed to have not received our May mortgage payment. No changes had been made to our account information and there were no issues with any other payments. They charged us late fees and continually sent letters in the mail that we did not pay. We provided proof of payment, statements, and even had a conference call with our bank and PNC to prove that the funds had left our account and were not returned. After over 2 months of calls, emails, etc. they FINALLY found the error and they were 100% at fault for losing our money. The reasoning she gave didn't even make sense. I truly think they were trying to scam us out of another mortgage payment. Also they refuse to make up for the HOURS that I spent on this issue that was their fault. They said ""oops"" and ""sorry there is nothing we can do for you."" Unbelievable. STEER CLEAR! THIS BANK IS TRASH!!!!"
1345,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst bank…EVER!!!!!  I wasn’t given a choice if I wanted this bank, it was forced on me as it merged with Bbva (my bank).  PNC holds checks deposited too long. I deposit a check same bank same amount once a week (5years) and they still hold it for at least 4 days before applying to my account. The app very seldom works properly."
1346,1118,PNC Bank,"This is one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had as a member at a bank. The tellers were extremely rude and very unhelpful every time I went into the branch nearby. It didn’t take me long to figure out why this institution was at the bottom of the corrupt banking world with unnecessary fees, poor customer service and money laundering schemes. Pathetic!!"
1347,1118,PNC Bank,"Again with another complaint. When I opened an account I went through BBVA and I absolutely loved them. At the time to avoid any kind of fees all I had to do was add a savings account, which I did. Now that it's PNC all that is out the window. You have to either ha for a direct deposit of 500 every month or keep a balance of five hundred dollars in your account. My money gets spent as fast as it comes in, I will never keep that much in my checking and I don't work a job that does direct deposit anymore. I shouldn't have to take out of savings to cover these fees because that would defeat the purpose of having a savings account. I wouldn't complain if I had fees coming out of one account but I have two checkings, one savings and a credit card through with fees that all add up, fees I didn't have before. I beleive that if you were a BBVA customer prior to transitioning to PNC then the contract they signed should follow them. I didn't sign up for PNC, I was forced to merge. I was told I would get a a call from the escalations department regarding the issues in two to three business days. When I never received the call I called PNC back and the customer service rep told me that I already received a call and that the matter was resolved. I told her I absolutely did not receive a call and the problem was not resolved and to say a matter has been resolved just simply because you want to avoid the issue is just plain bad business practice. They said they would open it back up and someone you'd give me a call, we'll see. I NEVER had any problems with BBVA. I've had all sorts of problems transitioning to PNC."
1348,1118,PNC Bank,"Honestly they do not care about you unless you are a millionaire. You can get much better interest rates on money markets and savings. For example, on a money market account, you can get a .04 APR rate. At a smaller credit union, you can get a .4 APR rate - a tenfold increase. Wells Fargo and Bank America offer roughly the same low money market and savings rates. One has to wonder why this is"
1349,1118,PNC Bank,"Rude and very unprofessional,they think they are the best but just look at their website design and app.. it’s really behind from all the major banks out there. They refuse to make things convenient for their customers and would let me go download and print 500 plus of check images myself."
1350,1118,PNC Bank,"It is almost unheard of for me to think so poorly of an organization to take time to write a negative review. But months of consistently terrible experience with PNC have driven me to it.A poorly executed acquisition of my account from another bank (BBVA) resulted in me not having online access to several thousand dollars for months. Buggy web site, a broken account recovery process, account reps that were consistently unable to get me access... even their automated voice prompts are awful, with a synthesized voice that sounds like it came from the 80s.After a recent (and unsuccessful) call attempting to have them to cancel my account and send me my funds, I tried to use their own automated survey system to give them feedback, but the survey links quickly expire. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a financial institution, by a lot. I'd almost rather give up my money than have to do business with PNC. Thankfully after more than 6 months, many phone calls and numerous attempts I was finally able to log in and access my account."
1351,1118,PNC Bank,"I went into the branch to link my accounts as informed to do so by the customer service rep over the phone. The individual in the branch was unable to locate one of my accounts, therefore, I had to go home and find the account numbers. When I returned, the problem was corrected after showing proof of the account. I then needed to make a deposit into my checking account which went smoothly. My second transaction is not going smoothly.  I wrote a check from my business line of credit and was informed by the teller that she needed to speak with her manager because she had never cashed a business check from a business line of credit. I’ve now been waiting for 40 minuets while she talks on the phone, help the other teller, etc, without informing me of where she’s at in the process with my transaction. I never had to go through this with BBVA."
1352,1118,PNC Bank,"Really bad service, employees have attitudes. Fees fees fees and no customer service. Horrible."
1353,1118,PNC Bank,I'm getting real sick of their mobile banking services being down once every week
1354,1118,PNC Bank,They stole my kid's money. Closed the account without our knowledge and just didn't give the money back. They steal kids' baby savings.
1355,1118,PNC Bank,I have been with PNC for almost a year now and it’s never shown me a balance I didn’t have. I looked back at my account and it said I had $300 and I was like awesome I can get home supplies for our moving. I did and everything was fine and it gave me a balance of 43 which was what I planned. I looked back at the account a day later and now it’s at -225. So apparently the app was buggy and didn’t give me actual amount I had. Instead it was showing me the money I had pending. This has never happened to me before and I tried contacting customer service and all they said was I have extended time and have 24 hours to pay to back. So I returned all of the supplies back to Walmart to get my $261 back and it does take a few days for them to return to money. I ask customer service for more extended time and they somehow can’t and their overdraft fees are crazy. So I’m still going to have a negative after this.
1356,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been with PNC FOREVER... I wouldn't dream of going with another.  I just got off the phone with Destiny, and she was tremendously helpful.  I'm going through a lot in my life right now and feeling overwhelmed trying to get my ducks in a row and folks like her are a God-send"
1357,1118,PNC Bank,Worst bank in the world!!!  You better think twice go elsewhere if possible. I absolutely hate everything about this bank. I will be switching banks next month!
1358,1118,PNC Bank,
1359,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst banking app. Always a problem. Error codes or trouble connecting, not available at this time. Come on PNC you need to do better."
1360,1118,PNC Bank,My online account was hacked.  They said because I used my debit card in the middle of the “hack” they can’t refund the money.  Don’t bank here.  They suuuuuuuuuuck!   Just like all the other reviews. Talk to 5 people get 5 different answers.Update:   We need the news to join in on pnc and the fact that they know they were hacked and still not refunding my money.
1361,1118,PNC Bank,I have been a member of PNC for years now…I have held a substantial amount of money in my savings that is for a poor person….I called today to ask for a refund on a overdraft fee and didn’t get the refund this is the first time my bank account has went to zero in years I have a child…thanks PNC
1362,1118,PNC Bank,"My child started a new job and proudly deposited her hard earned paycheck into her account. AFTER PNC processed her funds they decided the check was fraudulent and froze her accounts! Her employer has reached out to help rectify the problem, but PNC won’t hear of it. They won’t allow her employer to stop payment because they have already transferred the funds. How can they say it’s fraudulent and yet process the money???Horrible business practices. Go somewhere else!"
1363,1118,PNC Bank,"the worst bank ever.  I was on auto pay,   PNC stopped my auto pay so i was 1 payment late.   for the 1 late payment my credit score dropped by 84 points.  PNC would not correct it.   do not deal with this bank.   they will charge extra and ruin your credit."
1364,1118,PNC Bank,"I would stash my money in my toilet bowl before i went to these people.  Dealing with them is terrible, a bunch of ""special"" folks work here.  They make you jump through hoops for simple tasks and at the end it fails, or sorry we cannot do that! And the amount of time wasted on the phone with them!!! uselessDO NOT USE THEM AS YOUR BANK.  Zero customer service.  Each person you speak to has their own rules, if you speak with 5 people about the same thing, you will get 5 different answers!!!  I couldn't believe it!  1 month so far of trying to get a wire transfer to work and still can't do it.  I can't wait till its done so i can run away from these guys!"
1365,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC advertise that they’re such a great bank, but they charge for so many things that it’s impossible to actually feel that they’re for the consumers. Example: If I have $60000.00 in my account I’m on vacation checking into my resort needing access to $2,500 of my funds I can’t. Even if I need additional funds from my Savings account on vacation or other purchases and I have a $1,000.00 limit. Whereas with NetSpend I can use my funds,they’re not into capitalizing on fees. I find PNC is all about fees being collected every way you turn. It sucks!"
1366,1118,PNC Bank,"I closed an account to consolidate funds into escrow. It took 45 minutes to get someone who could do it. This manager said he could not wire funds but would send a cashiers check overnight for Saturday delivery. Saturday, no check, Monday no check. Called again. Over 2 hrs getting transferred around and put on hold. They could not get me any tracking number. Told me to wait 7-10 days as it went out in regular mail. We are talking over $250,000. So they put in regular mail, no traceability, won’t get here in time for escrow and they could care less. Unprofessional, unacceptable, and I will NEVER use PNC again. I would leave negative stars if possible."
1367,1118,PNC Bank,The worst bank ever! If you had your account switched  over from BVAA check your new PNC account. They are stealing your money.
1368,1118,PNC Bank,"Horrible customer service! On hold forever and nothing is ever accomplished. Mobile app doesn't work. If u bank out of state, don't waste your time."
1369,1118,PNC Bank,Dont bank here. Online account is always under maintenance and customer service sucks they are no help and money hungry.
1370,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could give less than 1, I would. This bank is HORRIBLE. Horrible customer service, horrible user options, terrible all around. I hate this bank and nobody should ever use them, especially when dealing with a death in the family. Made things even worse, if that is possible."
1371,1118,PNC Bank,I would give them no stars if I could! The saga continues! Manager suppose to call me ! Big surprise I haven’t received a call!
1372,1118,PNC Bank,"Stay away for your own good. Bank puts my checking account in the negative $1000+ somehow of what I do not own???? They then immediately charge me multiple overdraft fees and wouldn't offer a refund for their screwup even though I was very diligent about contacting their customer support the moment my transactions were ""pending"" before they were able to refund my balance. Lost $200 from their mistake and a lot of wasted time with customer service and years of my life from frustration."
1373,1118,PNC Bank,"Awful bank. At the 1511 Walnut St branch in Philadelphia, I was informed that I could request a debit card AFTER enrolling in online banking. Today I was informed by an IT specialist (Steve) for online banking that I needed a debit card to COMPLETE  online banking enrollment. Called the local branch representative at 1511 Walnut about the feedback I received and he changed his statement to align with the phone rep. In disbelief, I kept calling and calling PNC Bank and eventually found someone that informed me that the representative at the local branch who added me to my husband's account did not complete the process correctly. The phone rep made the necessary changes/updates and I was able to enroll into online banking WITHOUT a debit card. This was after 4 hours of phone calls between the local branch and the phone representatives. Ridiculous."
1374,1118,PNC Bank,This is the worst bank that I have ever dealt with. They screwed up my checking account and refused to fixed up and blame me for my account for being negative. Do not bank with this bank if you wish to have money and not having your money disappear for no known reason. Also they will hold onto your paycheck for however long they wish before making the money available in your account.
1375,1118,PNC Bank,"I have had to fight with this scam company every since they bought out BBV who where wonderful.I spend in upwards of 2 hours every single month trying to pay my car payment. The automated system doesn't work, they can't help you by phone they want to mail you everything in a plain unmarked envelope. They send me a new PIN number every month and they never work. This company needs to be shut down.They are a complete rip off, no one knows how to help you. They sent me a letter asking me to call someone named Scott, he never answers. Dialed 0 got some lady named Debbi, she couldn't help either.Complete fraud of a company."
1376,1118,PNC Bank,"Ever since this bank bought out BBVA/Compass bank it's been a complete disaster and nothing but headaches.  First of all, the PNC Bank website is not user friendly. I was locked out of it whenever I logged into the site from a different computer and was forced to change my password 3 different times in order to get properly logged in. A few of my auto payments that were set up with Compass Bank never carried through with PNC Bank.  I hadn't realized this until I got notice of a lapsed monthly payment from merchants that I've always been in good standing with.  If you need to know the routing number with any of your PNC Bank accounts, it is very difficult to find on their website. Transferring money from another bank can also take several days to be deposited into your PNC checking account. 6 business days have passed since I initiated a money transfer and the deposit still hasn't showed up in my PNC account. This is unacceptable.  I could've walked to this bank from my house and made the deposit sooner.  I'm seriously considering dropping this bank and switching to another one."
1377,1118,PNC Bank,"If you'd like to spend countless hours on the phone being transferred from department to department because your small business credit card keeps denying Amazon charges, than this is the bank for you! If you think your time is valuable and your credit card should be able to accept basic charges, than you might want to look elsewhere for your business needs."
1378,1118,PNC Bank,"I'll begin by saying I am a business account member of pnc banking. Called in to explore the possibilities of a commercial loan. The conversation was horrific from the get-go. Way too much arrogance, as if this phone rep knew how PNC operates in every branch. I was tired from global travel, and this dude had no patience for what I was trying to explain. I was Amaazed that he represented PNC's brand of excellence. He claimed PNC had no ""appetite"" for what my query was pertaining to, and was a defeated conversation from the start. I should have listened to my instincts and just hung up, rather than entertain this so called  PNC rep. I have had better conversation etiquette with a non-American rather than this gentleman. If it wasn't for the decades of doing good business with PNC that has always supported my financial needs, I would have decided to never deal with PNC Banking in any capacity after dealing with this PNC.com rep's know it all attitude. If I was on the show ""Apprentice"", ""you're fired!"" comes to mind.Thanks for listening to me vent, y'all are great."
1379,1118,PNC Bank,"June 30, 20224:55PMPNC BANKMichelle, in the Morgage department at 866 622 2657.I spoke to Michelle to obtain the reinstatement amount owed for this Promissory Note signed by my wife and I at the PNC Bank in Raeford in 2015.  Michelle stated that I was not on the loan. Then I asked, why did I sign all of those promissory pages for that Note/Loan in Raeford? She told me over and over again that I was not on the loan, However, the attorney that represents PNC on this home foreclosure has me listed. Again, with a hateful attitude she remarked, ""How many times do I have to tell you that you are not on the loan"" Michelle, maybe you should talk to that law firm that sent me these letters.PNC - check the recording"
1380,1118,PNC Bank,"I was a very happy camper with BBVA who took over Compass. The takeover and quality of continuing service was excellent and I recommended them to everybody.In 2021, BBVA sold to PNC. It has been the worst transition and service, whether in person, on 800 customer service, or thru app/online, is terrible. I have closed one account and will close remaining as well as yank my CD as soon as possible. Today's debacle was trying to obtain 2021 records that 800 and local office point to each other to do and both insist they cannot provide to me. What a mess they are."
1381,1118,PNC Bank,"I had an issue with my Business Banking Zelle feature. I called customer service and they’ve thrown me back and forth between departments to walk me through resetting my Username, Password & security questions.All three have been reset and the customer service reps said I must not have reset them correctly (although they walked me through the process step by step and verified that I was doing it correctly)Naturally, I have grace. The customer service rep “Lindsay” has an unenthusiastic attitude and sounds like she hates her job or is having a terrible day. I get that people have bad days so that’s not a huge issue.However, I’ve been put on hold 4 times adding my total phone call duration or 2 hours and 24 minutes as I type this. Is this normal? Should it not be way easier for PNC’s “reputable” customer service department to troubleshoot issues and solve problems?I love PNC’s online banking features but I will now be shopping around for a different home bank to hold my money and take out loans with.PNC lost me as their loyal customer."
1382,1118,PNC Bank,I only can say a few words trash scum filthy Banks all the way to the restrooms with vaginal blood poop toilet paper sticking to the inside of the toilet bowl the workers there are disgraceful and horrible and if they treat their homes like that man I'll tell you what
1383,1118,PNC Bank,"Our mortgage was transferred to PNC. We've been trying for four months now to get the PMI insurance removed since our home value far exceeds the minimum requiring PMI. It's been a continual cycle of misinformation, restarts, and run-around. We've jumped through every hoop and at the other side is another roadblock. The institution continues to enjoy robbing us of the PMI insurance premium each month while they stall and block what we're entitled to do. It's akin to a scam.  Someone called from PNC welcoming us to the bank and offering us more services. I had to laugh at the absurdity. Have to say we'll run from PNC as soon as we are able."
1384,1118,PNC Bank,"The customer service is actually so bad, and when they make a mistake they don't apologize and they don't take responsibility to fix the problem, i am done with this bank .."
1385,1118,PNC Bank,On line banking is horrible I have explained 23 times to 5 different reps the simple fact that I need my new credit card linked to my online profile.  Still isn’t done after 1and half hours on the phone. They are now transferring me to a 6th rep.  This portion of pnc is horrible
1386,1118,PNC Bank,"Yesterday, 06/21/2022,sent me a text saying balance was $18+.  Went to Walmart, spent $12.87.  Then went to Wawa and spent $3.39.  Now they are saying the balance, before those transactions was only $11.43.  After the $12.87 which they let clear they also allowed the other transaction, for $3.39 and the account is now negative somehow.  This is not the first time they have done this to me.  Tell me my balance is one thing, go to the store spend money, they allow to clear but supposedly overdraw the account.  Bunch of liars and thieves.  Lets see if I get charged $36 for a $4.83 overdraft.  Liars and thieves"
1387,1118,PNC Bank,They have terrible customer service. In competent rude dishonest uncaring employees. They made multiple mistakes on mu account and didn't take responsibility or correct the problem  They opened a branch in Sacramento without a mamger and employees who were not trained properly how to open an account. None seemed to know what was going on and none in charge. Charged high and unreasonable fees. My bank statement came unsealed and none would get me put a password gor security. Theu have alot of young rude immature employees.  They wrongfully closed my account because a manger didn't file my paperwork to whomever she was supposed to and then PNC sent my life savings in a check in the mail without a phone xall. They never gave me my bonuses because they misinformed when they opened the accounts on the conditions.  In fact they closed my accounton the day I was supposedthe receive the bonus.. I'm questioning whether they are a legitimate bank. The worst experiences of a bank of my life. STAY AWAY!
1388,1118,PNC Bank,"This is a bank that gladly intakes your $$$ but finds it impossible to honor withdrawal of the same $$$. Deposited a check for $100k +/- weeks ago. 13 seconds to deposit check. Waited weeks for check to clear/verify. Went to branch to inform them of a large withdrawal I needed to make. Gave them a WEEKS notice. No calls, no update. Went in today to pickup MY money, was told it will be another week. I needed that $$$ this weekend so now my plans are shot. How is it that it takes 13 seconds to take your money & at least 2 weeks (if not more as I don't have MY money in hand) to get your money back to you? For my next magic trick after flaming this incompetent bank on line I am covering my car with don't bank at PNC, ask me why! posters & I believe I will turn it into a YouTube video. Since they ruined my plans for this weekend I have nothing but time on my hands. Run far, run fast, but run as far away from PNC bank as you can!"
1389,1118,PNC Bank,"After years and years of banking with PNC, I couldn’t take it anymore. I get absolutely NO benefits from using this bank. The interest for my savings account is 0.01% a year. And the customer service is and has always been next to useless. It took me 30 minutes the other day for them to add my cellphone number to my account because I wasn’t receiving the 2-step verification code call. And I got passed around to three different people. Now I’m trying to close my account and the rep I’m “speaking” to hasn’t responded in over 15 minutes. I’m fed up and so glad to be moving on to Discover where I get cash back, tons of benefits, and my savings account has an interest rate of 0.6% annually. What a difference. I wish I’d done this sooner."
1390,1118,PNC Bank,"After years of putting up with rude employees and their far below par tech department, I have decided to call it quits with PNC. Reviews are not supposed to contain offensive language so that is really about all I can say."
1391,1118,PNC Bank,"Applied for a HELOC and working with the PNC Branch at Advent Ct, Waverly Place, Cary, NC.  The process is fraught with confusion, there is no employee accountability.  The communication is incomplete, poorly written, and unprofessional.  The employees do not timely call back or call back at all.  The Branch Manager is as bad as the employees.  I submitted a package based upon their request, dropped it off at the bank with the Branch Manager, then receive a request for more information which contains the same information I've already provided."
1392,1118,PNC Bank,"Poor customer service, nonexistent interest rates, incompetent, overzealous, and unreachable fraud department - avoid this bank!"
1393,1118,PNC Bank,"I reported what I knew to be fraudulent activity on my account. I was scammed when trying to get a loan. I contacted the bank, gave them all the information I had and asked for their help resolving the negative balance that the scammers left me with. PNC passed me around to different people for an entire week with no resolution. When my direct deposit from work hit the account they held it. No PNC took my entire paycheck. I was robbed twice, once by scammers a second time by PNC."
1394,1118,PNC Bank,I paid $200 on my credit card (the only account I have with them) and they have no record of it!  They lost $200!!!  They are a terrible bank and I will not do business with them again.
1395,1118,PNC Bank,"I only had a long term savings account through their online banking as my emergency & car fund. Well that was a JOKE, after putting in money for several years and having no problems, I finally wanted to pull money out to buy a car. That’s where the problems began. They apparently have a $5000 daily and monthly external transfer limit - NOT MADE CLEAR AT SIGN UP. I called MULTIPLE times trying to get this raised to approx $20000 to no avail. Tried to wire on the app, couldn’t cause I didn’t have a debit card. Tried to wire over the phone and got automatically hung up on when I couldn’t input a debit pin. Couldn’t get a new external account verified because I got married and my name changed. They wanted me to go into the closest branch and show my marriage certificate. Fine except I live in Washington state and the only branches left are east coast.I ended up just closing the account and having them mail me a cashiers check with all the money. That was the only way I could access more than $5000 of MY MONEY. Thank goodness the money was just needed for a car and not an actual emergency. Prepare to have a hard time getting your money out unless you plan to close the account.Well see if the check ever actually comes."
1396,1118,PNC Bank,"This has got to be THE WORST bank ever! I have been on hold for 49:13 minutes disputing a fraudulent charge on my credit card, and they can't seem to figure out a solution. I kept getting transferred from department to department and they are completely USELESS employees! I will NEVER get another credit card from them ever again! I can't believe I had to PAY for fraudulent charges!!! Awful customer service! They don't even deserve ONE star!"
1397,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been with this bank for over 12 years I have a checking and a Credit Card account. This bank is useless to the working class. They continue to close branches, going automated and continue to raise their fees. No wonder their net income for 2021 is 5.7 BILLION $’s. This bank forgets to help the people and just want to cater to the 2% elite. Shameful bunch, shameful bank."
1398,1118,PNC Bank,UP UNTIL NOW MY TRUST IN YOU TO ACTUALLY HELP OUT WHICH I THINK THAT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT I HAVE NO ACCESS TO WHAT I CONSIDER BELONGS TO. EVERYDAY I HAVE TO KEEP CALLING BACK TO CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT AN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED AND NOW WHICH UNDER INVESTIGATION. WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT LATE FEES HAS BEGUN TO PILE UP ALL BECAUSE I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED MY DEBIT CARD. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE BEFORE
1399,1118,PNC Bank,"This bank literally closed my bank account and refuses to give me my $4,000 that was in the account. It's been months and they won't even answer back to my emails now"
1400,1118,PNC Bank,"Does not feel that PNC is customer focused or oriented. After acquisition of Simple/BBVA, no option for free checking  is unreasonable when the company you acquired offered that service. Closing all accounts with this bank."
1401,1118,PNC Bank,"My debit cards was stolen. I went into a branch to cancel the card and did. I was not allowed to dispute the fraudulent charge made 4 days earlier, as it still was in pending status.  I immediately filed a police report. I was told by the cops that I need the full debit card numbers in the reportIn order to assign an investigator and they can start work. I then called the bank to get said (already cancelled) card numbers. They refused to give me the numbers over the phone. Ok, if cancelled why not? Then I went straight to the branch to pull out all but a relatively small amount of my money, with the intention of closing it as soon as I open an account elsewhere. I disputed the charge made fraudulently (finally, it's now 5 days ago!). I then asked the teller for the cancelled card numbers and she read them to me OUT LOUD with 2 other people in the lobby! I asked how she could do that but I could not be given them over the phone. Her answer. ""This is not a recorded line"". Along with other statements which indicated the primary concern was for the tellers jobs, not my secure. Concerning the other person in the lobby she stated ""he was already walking away"" this was not true. In addition THIS IS A POSSIBLE RECORDED LINE TO ANYONE WITH A CELL PHONE. I then requested to pull out the vast majority of my money cash, less than $50,000. They did not have it! But she said ""for my trouble"", she would ""waive the cashiers check fee"". As she prepared my check, a question popped in my head. When she returned I asked her. If the card numbers were reported stolen, what could one do with that information anyway? ""A lot!"" She replied. Then she proceeded to give me Stealing a Credit Card 101. Yup, she spoke to me for 10 more minutes on what I could do with someone's reported stolen credit card numbers! YOUR MONEY IS NOT SAFE HERE, if in fact,  it were there anyway."
1402,1118,PNC Bank,"I wish there was a no star selection. Crooks that lie and deceive on the phone and have no intentions on helping any customers. No communication to customers but make changes without explanation and PNC has bad business practices. And will place anything on your creditworthiness, PNC just don’t give a F. You guys (PNC) are horrible. And still waiting on a call back since Feb.2022"
1403,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC would give me a Small home loan for 110,000 but not a personal loan for $10,000 with all three credit scores over 750 I’m Banking with another bank I’m close that account Soon"
1404,1118,PNC Bank,"Most horrible banking experience ever.  My deceased mother had an account with them and her accounts were converted to an estate account.  I cannot wait to be able to close this account out.  Everything- I mean everything- is a challenge, from writing a check and not having it rejected for signature inconsistencies to online accounts being made inactive. I dont have time to deal with this place.  All I want to do is pay her bills without a hassle!!!!"
1405,1118,PNC Bank,Horrible bank!  Extremely shady and dishonest.  They'll charge you fees that you've never even heard of.
1406,1118,PNC Bank,Seems like the worst bank I’ve ever opened an account with. App is completely useless and you just continue to get kicked out of it anytime you try to enroll in anything. Website online is just as bad. The directions to enroll in Zelle are impossible to follow and there’s zero directions or guidance that match what is happening on the screen. Useless in every way.
1407,1118,PNC Bank,Worst bank ever. you CANT ACCESS YOUR MONEY AFTER 10PM. They shut down the mobile app as well so you can’t even login until 5ams . It’s ridiculous. DO NOT BANK WITH THEM!!!
1408,1118,PNC Bank,"It takes 5 to 7 days to to process a transfer from one account to another.. funny thing is they remove the amount you are transferring immediately from your account… but you don’t see it until 5 days later,, everything is slow in this bank.. I’m closing all my accounts.. is not worth it.."
1409,1118,PNC Bank,"Short and sweet, PNC sucks. It takes 5+ days for a payroll check to be deposited into your account. Never had this issue with Wells Fargo"
1410,1118,PNC Bank,"This is the worst bank I have ever interacted with. I was forced into becoming a customer due to the merger with union bank. In this short time PNC has locked me out of online banking, created charges on a line of credit that I didn’t know existed and wasted a significant amount of my time with their inefficient organization. I do not trust this company and wish I could get my mortgage with anyone else. Do not bank with PNC or you will be extremely unhappy and concerned about the security of your money."
1411,1118,PNC Bank,"The absolute worst…yet still managing to sink to lower depths. PNC seems confused about what a bank is/does..basically math…and whose money they have.  Hint:  it’s not theirs!  I can count on one hand the overdrafts I’ve had in the decades I’ve been their customer (usually because some someone illegally took thousands of dollars from the account which has happened more than once). And, although Ive been their ‘very good customer’..their words.. and overdrafts are backed up by my other PNC accounts, they still charge you.  They make it almost impossible to do anything about your account/money. Basically, take the day off to get through to anyone…who will usually send you somewhere else. They’ll give your money away to anyone. As I said, thousands have illegally been taken from my account which processed IMMEDIATELY, but a $10 check to me will sit in pending for days.  When my new debit card needed activated, I had to call…even though they say you can do it online…on their site that’s down for updates constantly, and it used to be automatic based on your phone number, but now it’s wait and wait and get transferred and hung up on.  Yet, after I activated new card, they were still processing charges on old card..so a lot of autopay accounts took money twice! I’ve put a limit on when to be notified if a charge exceeds a certain amount. Never happens. They’ll cash a ‘check’ written on a napkin from a stranger, but I have to answer 12 questions to speak to anyone, and, of course, I’m wrong, because I suddenly forgot my pin or SSN?! They are not only criminally incompetent, they’ll do anything to try and overdraft your account, find anyway to take your money, and don’t ever get a credit card through them….highest interest I’ve seen.  But although I pay my card in full, on time, plus whatever interest they charge so I’m actually paying off debt, they get upset if you use your card!  ‘Update your income!’emails come as soon as you charge anything. It’s the same income they’ve been playing fast and loose with for years. It’s no surprise they’re failing, closing branches, etc. Hopefully they’ll be bought by a competent banking institution…like the mob."
1412,1118,PNC Bank,Mobile app is always broken. Website is always down. Phones are always busy. Its like the only way to EVEN LOOK AT YOUR MONEY is to physically go to a branch. We live in 2022. How the hell does PNC not know how to get their mobile and online banking stable? I wish they had never bought Compass bank because since the merger Ive had nothing but problems. IF I could give this piece of crap company 0 stars I would. Something as simple as checking your account balance shouldn't be such a hassle.
1413,1118,PNC Bank,"Your information will be stolen repeatedly and as soon as you step outside your state and try to buy anything, they’ll flag every purchase until your card can no longer be used."
1414,1118,PNC Bank,"I waited to write a review until I had to leave PNC. The transition from BBVA to PNC was horrendous. The branch on Woodway in Houston, TX would have conflicting answers about their inefficient website. The branch manager never returned my messages/calls. All I can surmise is, they do not care about banking account customers. I am currently moving to a new bank.Dr. Kelsie King"
1415,1118,PNC Bank,I have been with this bank since 1999. I use to like their service. they have reduced all the perks I had when I signed up. They are ONLY about trying to get as much of your money from you in fees. I am changing banks
1416,1118,PNC Bank,Horrible bank to have your money in. Starting with local branch to the corporate customer service. I no longer trust this bank with my money at all. They lost my trust completely.  Please don't bamk with PNC you will regret it it trust me.
1417,1118,PNC Bank,Avoid PNC especially if you have a business. You still can't do wire transfers through the app. It's insane. Their interface is still from the 90s and their customer service is abysmal. Avoid at all costs.
1418,1118,PNC Bank,"Avoid this bank at all costs.  I called PNC bank about suspicious activity on my account. Someone who is not authorized to use my account was allowed to deposit s few dollars into my account via an ATM without any security at all. They did not need a PIN number or my card just my account number. PNC confirmed that they could not tell where it was done from since it was not a PNC ATM, this could have been done in China for all I know.Point is it was allowed zeroesecurity and then they kept asking me if I wanted to dispute it, really?? I tell you unauthorized activity and you have to ask 5+ times if I really was to dispute it?Allowing a deposit with no security is like letting a thief come look in your front window and check the door lock without a concern. And to not even have a clue where it was done from, relly??? The bank branch where I live the make you set an appointment to talk to them about your money and they don't even try to keep the appointment.All around PNC is an epic failure in banking and customer service."
1419,1118,PNC Bank,"I dislike PNC BANK very much.  First of all, on many occasions the ATM machines have issues.  Some nights they won't accept deposits, and other times you can't even withdraw your money.  Also, many of the branches ATM'S are in dark areas that are not well lit up and could be an accident waiting to happen.  I see a huge difference between them and Chase. I also just had my account hacked and PNC tried to blame me for one of the charges to Spectrum. They said because I use Spectrum that I must of did that charge. Really? I wasn't in Sacramento the day that person hacked my account.  PNC...do your jobs and dig a little deeper. You don't need to pin things on your customers. I am planning on closing my account soon enough.  I don't recommend PNC  bank.  They are horrible and have shotty customer service. The ATM'S always have issues, it's not a good place to do banking at all. My fiance banks with Key Bank and he loves it."
1420,1118,PNC Bank,"I wish  could give this bank a double zero.And let's get this straight.I only use this bank cause my state requires me to for my small business.If it wasn't for the state they would probably have no business.At least not mine.I have issues w them on a wklyl and sometimes twice a wk.Everything from broken ATM'sTo poor customer service kn the phone.you get absolutely no where with.nothing accomplished. Thanks for just wasting my time.Just talk circle around you.They allow double charges to go throw and wait 10days to get MY MONEY back.and I'm not talking peanuts.like $200But yet they grab that service fee w no problem in the begin of the month,for what yous don't do nothing.I tried to shop around to close this account.But there all the same.I diffently hate banks, and this is exactly why?It my hard earned money not yours.LEAVE IT ALONE.DONT TOUCH MY MONEY"
1421,1118,PNC Bank,"We loved PNC prior to the pandemic. Once places started to reopen, PNC ""executives"" determined that not all branches need to have tellers. Of course, this affected the one by my office. You can only deposit at the ATM machine, & 50% of the time the ATM machine is down so you have to drive to another location. As soon as I get the OK from my boss, we will be shopping for a new banking relationship with another bank."
1422,1118,PNC Bank,"Aware we were almost done with the car payment we placed a call to ask for the pay-off amount to ensure we were sending the right amount.Last payment of $406.95 was made on 02/11/2022 (monthly payment was $380).As with other accounts we were waiting for the car title but never received so on 03/14/2022 another call was placed to ask them about the title. Customer service checked my account and after a few minutes I was told everything was in order that if I want the car title I need to request it at my county or local DMV.Recently I was notified that there was a event to my credit report which affected my credit score; when I checked my credit report I noticed the loan in question (PNC Bank/BBVA) is sending them a report as I owe them money. Like I owe them for March payment and this event is affecting my credit score negatively. I was never late to payments and I did my due diligence to call and ask for a pay-off amount. Wanting to clarify this situation I called again 04/15/22. On this day, I got transferred on multiple occasions and after a little over 2 hours I was told that it shows I owe money but that someone will call me to clarify the situation with me. Also my contract that i sign on 1/21/2016 stated that my monthly payment is $370.07 but them pnc change to $380.00 without explanation. If someone show up and repocess my car for this I will contact an attorney,  I still waiting for my tittle. I contact them numerous of time with no resolutionThis situation is not the best for customer satisfaction.I got a call from Lori Middendorf she was rude disrespectful and mean. I pay all my bill on time and they ruin my credit. I believe they did fraud to me. Very dissatisfied"
1423,1118,PNC Bank,"This is the worst bank ever. Fees out the butt, horrible employees, wait times and branches."
1424,1118,PNC Bank,I called to speak to a bank rep. After the call a pnc app appeared on my phone. I did not put it there. This same bank rep has been involved in changing my bank voicing code. I put it in when opening accounts and it did not work. He entered it on the computer. He gave me a new code. Now it works. Who put the app on my phone?
1425,1118,PNC Bank,PNC bank is awfully. They treat new customers like criminals!! I'm very dissatisfied.  The put a hold on a deposit from a pnc bank check.  That's insane.
1426,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been a loyal PNC bank customer for 15+ years and have never experienced any issues. I have 3 accounts in my family and a credit card with PNC. This past week I was involved with a scam and was denied my dispute without even being asked for my documentation. They do not feel they have any need to protect their customers and make it very easy for these scams to take place. Aside from this, I have spoken with several customer service managers who made me feel like my business was not of value to them. One asked me ""so why exactly are you calling me?"" and one actually hung up on me. I will be closing ALL of my accounts with PNC and moving my business to my credit union who actually values it's customers."
1427,1118,PNC Bank,"I had an issue where someone went into the bank and cashed a check for $250.  I spoke with customer service and went into the bank.  They verified there was a check cashed and a check deposited (I deposited $250 to cover the withdrawn cash).  Now the ""executive complaint team"" is trying to tell me I only had a deposit for $250.  They sent me a statement that doesn't look like what I saw online. They claim to have sent me copies of the check but I have not received those copies.  Bottom line I'm out $250 and never want to deal with those people again."
1428,1118,PNC Bank,"They bought out our old bank, and automatically put me in an account that charges a monthly fee. When I called to see what could be done, I was on hold for an hour. The machine asked if I’d like a call back instead, I selected yes. I got a call back 2.5 hours later and no one could hear me, but I could hear OTHER people’s calls. Like their account info etc. I hung up and called back, when I never was able to speak to real person. I called my local branch and they escalated it. A woman from corporate left a message on my phone about the incident, I called and emailed her back repeatedly. She ghosted me. We’ve had nothing but problems with their online billing process, and recurring bills that we’ve set up experience issues almost every single month. Hate this bank with a passion."
1429,1118,PNC Bank,"horrible . dont use this bank. most that work there are not qualified. The worst part of this system is the IT team. They have to be the worst online bank system ever. When a problem you have to go to the branch or get a pop up to call some number where you get another incompetent person. As a 6 figure customer, this bank is first grade level performance."
1430,1118,PNC Bank,"This bank is ridiculous! This bank called and said that they noticed fraud on my card, we immediately closed my card, and expedited my new card to my address. When I received my new card they stated they could not activate it for three days. What’s the point in expediting it then??  I use this card for everything. I’m just thankful that I wasn’t traveling, because this whole waiting period Thing is ridiculous. Mind boggling stupidity. Users beware. If you want asinine answers from people who can’t do anything, this is your bank. Everyone else…find somewhere else to keep your money!!"
1431,1118,PNC Bank,"BBVA was 10x the bank PNC will ever be. I got forced to bank with PNC after they bought out BBVA. Since then their banking app is has crashed at least once every other day, they are charging banking fees on everything, account have fees, cashier's checks are 3x more to buy, customer service is handled from out of the country 40% of the time and sometimes getting a live person to talk to can take up to 2+ hours, yes I have waited. I am sure their are a myriad of other hidden fees I haven't had the nightmare of discovering yet. For anyone thinking about using PNC, DON'T!! BBVA and it's customers are being cannibalized  strictly for profit, PNC literally turned an awesome bank into a nightmare in less than 10 months."
1432,1118,PNC Bank,"Stay away from PNC bank if you want to keep your money safe - Unethical bank practiceClosed my high-yield savings account with PNC after receiving a letter that my account was deactivated due to inactivity. Called the bank and was told that unless I have some type of activity, the account would be deactivated and the funds would be turned over to the state. I have to physically call in at least every 3 years for the account to stay active. The fact that I log in on a regular basis apparently doesn't count. I asked them to close the account and transfer the funds to another bank. I opened 2 other savings account at the same time for the same amount with 2 different banks and they never deactivated my accounts.  I asked them to close the account and since they have a $5k limit on daily transfer out of the account, I told them I would accept a paper check ONLY because the rep told me the check would be overnighted. I never received my check. Over the next two weeks I called them numerous times, spoke to multiple supervisors, bounced around to different departments and no one could tell me when the check would be issued nor when I would receive it. I was told repeatedly that an escalation member would call me but no one has. I am outraged that PNC has over $100k of my money and refuses or incapable of telling me where my money is. Countless runarounds and lack of response makes PNC bank more of an unethical con bank than a legitimate bank. Filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau but who knows when they will get this resolved. I cannot believe a bank is allowed to behave this way and get away with it."
1433,1118,PNC Bank,"All locations are very slow,they take forever,I don't know why.when you order a debt card they also takes days before you receive it."
1434,1118,PNC Bank,"I've been a PNC customer (checking/savings) for about 5 years and at first was thrilled to have such a high (3+%) rate on savings accounts. Over the years, they steadily dropped it down to a paltry .04% (nothing good lasts forever). But I remained there as my primary bank, doing direct deposit and paying bills from the online website. Recently I found out that the only way to change your debit card PIN was to visit a branch or PNC ATM. Since I don't live in Pennsylvania, that's a little hard to do (no branches near me at all). With that said, I'm in the process of withdrawing all my funds and moving to another bank with better rates (and the ability to change a PIN online). PNC has chosen to remain in the ""dark ages"" of online banking - and their website/app user interface is pretty dated as well."
1435,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC doesn’t seem to be efficient when problems come up and I’m the one who has to waste my time clearing it up.The last time I had a problem with PNC I wrote a check for a medical bill and then I received another bill. I called PNC and was advised that a check was issued and to cancel the check. I should have call the hospital first as they did receive the check but had not processed the check. The PNC customer service person gave me the wrong advice. She should have told me that the check had been issued and I should wait a little longer. As it turned out the hospital charged me a fee for the cancelled check. They eventually refunded the fee but not without a lot of difficulty. Now I paid this hospital bill on the hospital website. Immediately after I received 2 emails from PNC indicating that the bill was paid twice. So I logged into my account and PNC does have the transaction listed as being paid twice. I called the hospital first this time and I was told that the payment was only in their system once, NOT twice. I was advised to call the bank. I called PNC and there ARE 2 payments made but since they did not hit the system yet I should call back tomorrow to get the one transaction disputed and a refund issued. I am truly afraid that the bill will not be paid and I will have to go through another mess to clear this up. Most of the time I have no problems with this bank BUT when an issue has come up it seems that the bank has made me jump through hoops to clear it up. Now I feel that when I call tomorrow there will be more hassle and a lot more time wasted to get this all cleared up."
1436,1118,PNC Bank,"Unhelpful and incomplete banking 'alternative'... why would anyone suggest institution as a viable option for personal banking?? Overdrafts are approved only at the bank's discretion, medication, emergency charges declined when other, non-urgent services are not...."
1437,1118,PNC Bank,"this bank told us NO ONE BUT THE MANAGER can open a Individual Money Market Account. You cannot walk in a get this kind of account ever you had to have an appointment and the first appointment they had was over a week later. Then they called us the morning of the appointment an cancelled said that we need to make another appointment and again their next appointment is again over a week later. This did not sound right to us I called other banks and no one ever heard of this. To make it short it turns out this was nothing but lies we had been told we went to another PNC location and they opened te Money Market Individual Account with in 15 minutes. This was an awful experience for us because we need to secure a large amount of money not have it laying around. In addition this woman that is the Branch Manager told repeatly she was ""to busy to fit us in"" WOW is this really the way PNC wants to treat their customers might want to think that over no good at all."
1438,1118,PNC Bank,"This bank is by far the worst bank I’ve ever conducted business with. I got a bonus check from my Job, and my employer processed a check. I did the mobile deposit that they claim is effortless, which was true. What is not effortless was getting my money. I called and a PNC rep tells me they have to put a hold on the check to verify funds. So you need to verify that you have enough money to deposit a little 700 dollar check. It’s your check!!! I’ve went round and round with them and keep getting different reasons why they can deposit their own  check. I know this will get nowhere but hopefully someone is looking for a bank and read this and NOT choose these clowns."
1439,1118,PNC Bank,"My mother was a BBVA customer.  After PNC bought BBVA they transferred her money to PNC and it was downhill from the start.  They were supposed to deposit all her CDs into her virtual wallet upon maturity.  We spent over an hour on the phone with “customer service” and were repeatedly assured this would be done.  Their “customer service” reps spoke very poor English and were literally incomprehensible.  I feel bad saying that because they were trying and I’m sure they needed the job, BUT if you can’t communicate that is a deal breaker in my book.  Prior to maturity they sent my mother an email saying that all 7 CDs would be automatically renewed.  After scheduling an appointment, we physically went to the nearest PNC branch where we waited an hour before being seen.  Needless to say, when we were finally called in for her appointment we cashed in all her CDs early, closed her accounts and walked out the door with a cashier’s check for all her funds.  I’ve dealt with many banks over the years and this one is the worst by miles.  Convoluted, bloated, they bombard you with junk mail and email, no matter which account preferences you have set.  I would not recommend them to my worst enemy- well maybe to Putin."
1440,1118,PNC Bank,Keep getting removed from my online banking account. Have to jump through hoops for hours to get reactivated. Avoid this bank!
1441,1118,PNC Bank,"I was a client with Simple, who got bought out by BBVA, which went downhill, then was bought out by PNC, and went downhill even faster. PNC has the slowest mobile app I've ever used. Log in, says you're overdrafted. Log out then back in, says you're just fine. Log out, then back in again, says it's unavailable. Need to call support? They barely speak English. Need to send a bill pay check? It may get there in 3 weeks...if you're lucky. Good thing is I know my money's somewhere. Bad thing is I can't do much with it or plan. I switched to Alliant Credit Union recently...lightning fast app, free checks with fast bill pay, sign up bonuses, high APR accounts, and their support is incredible."
1442,1118,PNC Bank,"They used to have fairly responsive customer service on-line, but it has gone downhill over the past couple of years. It is impossible to talk to a live person, and they don't even offer a direct link via email anymore to send a message through their portal. Since there are no 'brick and mortar' branches in the rural area where I now reside, it is extremely frustrating. Their customer service reps are knowledge-challenged to put it nicely."
1443,1118,PNC Bank,I inherited this terrible bank from BBVA.   Worst experienceI have ever gone through with a bank.   They will not return calls and when I go to local Branch they are so understaffed it is pitiful.   If you try drive in service you may be in line with only one car ahead of you for 20 to 30 minutes because the one teller is helping customers inside bank and drive in customers.  I had five accounts with them when they took over BBVA and finally have gotten down to two accounts.  Working on closing these last two accounts.
1444,1118,PNC Bank,"I have had nothing but trouble with this bank. If it weren’t for the clerks inside the bank , I wouldn’t be able to bank at all or have any of my debit cards working. Mobile ape  for banking is a joke. It works 1/3 of the time."
1445,1118,PNC Bank,They lie. I am a PNC customer for three years now business and personal. I have an established business store and phone online presence social media presence 411 duns established and all. PNC denied my business credit card score ranges from 649 to 689 and nothing bad on credit. Called the back line and they gave me a bunch of bull excuses. They switch around your transactions over the weekend to make it look like you have over drawn your account. I Dont Get a thing out of being a PNC customer but bull crap. DONT DO BUSINESS WITH PNC IT IS NOT WORTH IT!
1446,1118,PNC Bank,"DO NOT BANK AT PNC. They are incompetent and fraudulent, I’ve been banking at pnc for around 4 years and hope everyone that even thinks about banking there, absolutely DOES NOT GO THERE"
1447,1118,PNC Bank,"I asked two questions; do you have a cashback bonus, and do I qualify for the bonus.  The answer was yes to both questions.  I called customer service twice after opening the account, one person knew nothing about the bonus or how I would get it, and the final person said I was fine.  When I went to collect the money I was told I would not receive the money even though I was told by the banker I was qualified.  What a scam this bank is (PNC).  If they can't be honest about their bonuses what else do they lie about?"
1448,1118,PNC Bank,"I went to a branch, in person, to apply for a HELOC. I brought along the required IRS tax statements, brokerage statements, bank statements, and pay stubs. The woman there copied all of it electronically to include with my application, and supposedly sent it in.One week later, I got a letter in the mail from PNC telling me to provide that same data--they had not received it with the application submission. There was no trace of it.Somewhere, who knows where, my highly sensitive data is floating around and PNC has no idea where it is or who has access to it. I complained to the manager of the branch. and a MONTH later, I heard from their ""executive client relations"" office with contact info on who to follow up with.Both the email and phone # they provided were useless. Email was returned as Undeliverable, and the phone number was some poor medical office in PA who had been getting barraged with these calls. Inexcusable.PNC cannot find their butts with both hands and a flashlight. But more critically, they cannot find, and have no idea where they have sent, highly personal information.This bank is DANGEROUS. Stay the 'bleep' away."
1449,1118,PNC Bank,This bank is terrible in several ways. First off I have been a customer for over 20 years as it was supposed to be a perk of my wife's job. They have the worst website. Their employees at the bank turn over every 3 or 4 months. It's like they are training and then move on. We applied for a higher limit on our line of credit - we have FICO high 700 - 810. This process is still on going and they don't update us at all. We applied a month ago and still in process. We could have refinanced our house and gotten a line of credit from other lenders (they were offering) and now the interest rates have gone up..STAY AWAY - they suck
1450,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bought my mortgage from another company and we hit some rough patches …. Luckily Kristin W. took over the process and with a lot of hard work, empathy and street smarts was able to resolve the transfer of my mortgage . Thank you ."
1451,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been trying to work with customer service for online banking with PNC. After myriad of issues , I got an email today from somebody saying that it was escalated to the customer service department at a higher level. I called them back twice and sent two emails. Have still not been able to speak with anybody. The absolute worst customer service on the planet:-("
1452,1118,PNC Bank,"the bank is a sad attempt at a stream lined service. they are impossible to get any accurate info from. one consultent tell you a due date and the supervisor tells you another. really quick to hit your credit score for a late payment but when they have to reimburse you, they cant be any slower or less sympathetic to getting you the check. Rude and non assistive in customer support too. the accounts to my bbva were swallowed by this bank and they combined accounts that werent supposed to be. then changed the log in info without telling anyone. ive switched banks and i pray this buisness goes under for its crappy buisness practices."
1453,1118,PNC Bank,"Called to get the payoff amount for my house. I talked to Ashley last week who gave me an amount good till March 31, 2022. She advised I call before I write my check to confirm. I called and spoke to Deb who said we don't give pay offs over the phone. I told her but you do because I was given one. She said we can fax it for $20.00  or mail it.  I asked for a supervisor and was transferred to Carmen in the escalation department who proceeded to tell me we can only pay off the mortgage by Wire or Certified Bank Check, which of course costs a fee not incurred by PNC bank.Carmen disconnected my call.   I called back tonight and was told Carmen would call me back. It is now 7:58 pm EST with no call back.   As usual PNC Bank failed again in the customer service department. If you are smart you will pull your money and use a different bank. This isn't the first time this has happened.  As soon as my mortgage is paid off I am closing out my account for good.Do not recommend them and will make sure I tell everyone I know about the AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE they give."
1454,1118,PNC Bank,"My mom died, God Bless Her Soul, from complications of COVID November 2021. I'm her only child and beneficiary on her will and trust and was a trustee on her PNC checking account. They would not talk to me on the phone. I went to the nearest branch which told me to get a court order to release the funds to me, which I did. But they are still giving me a hard time and are holding on to her money for now."
1455,1118,PNC Bank,"Like other reviews I've seen for this Bank. They are in the business of taking customers money. My daughter recently passed away in another state. Her account was opened in the state I live in. I presented documentation of my being the administrator of her affairs as well as a death certificate to a branch in my area. These are documents that all other companies and institutions except. They will not close her account and release the small balance expecting me to travel to the state where she died, to get a piece of paper. Since they are in the business of keeping people's money from other reviews I've seen, I'm sure me telling them to keep hers accomplished their goals. By the way they are not accredited. Is there a ZERO rating?"
1456,1118,PNC Bank,"I present all required information to opening a business account request by the branch manager located at the Pompano, Florida location. It's now been 4 weeks and she will not return any of my calls. The worst experience ever. Avoid opening an account."
1457,1118,PNC Bank,"STAY AWAY from PNC bank and their website. Poor customer service and website glitches. This morning I was unable to login to my checking account. Calling customer service was of no help, they blamed my phone and my internet browser, and to seek help from the family members which is none of their business.  Then how come that I can login to another bank with no problem whatsoever?  Finally was able to login from both Chrome and Firefox, which I shouldn't be able to do according to the PNC customer service. This is how much they know. And my phone still works.  Apparently PNC website had a glitch which of course they won't admit. It's always customer's fault."
1458,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC does not provide correct payoffs, so you still owe them!"
1459,1118,PNC Bank,I finally had them reach out to me but it’s the same thing for a bed ridden person look at the age. So knowing that I my bank don’t accept cashier they still issue it to me saying that’s policy so may I see it or they lying.These people find all tricks there can be so be aware banking with them one day could be a nightmare. Pls pnc no more tricks or negotiating
1460,1118,PNC Bank,POOR customer service.  Credit card charges slow to post.  I frequently have to search online for postings that didn't download to Quicken.  Not a problem with other CCs.Corrections made by PNC do not appear as adjustments.  The charge or credit (correction) just dissappears.30-45 minute LONG hold times if you need to talk to customer service.
1461,1118,PNC Bank,So I have something pull out of my account that was not valid. First told me I had to wait for it to clear cool. Call back and the rep makes it sounds like I'm lying. Even through I told him I have the proof from the company that the money wasnt suppose to come out. Now they have over 600 tied up. And making other stuff bounce. But they going to want their money if I over draft. Worst company ever. They don't value their loyal customers. Pnc is just wants your money. I will be closing accounts with the immediately after I receive my money.
1462,1118,PNC Bank,"My review is strictly about their online app. It is beyond frustrating, and takes in inordinate amount of time to do simple things like....find your account number and/or the bank routing number. I have been with Compass Bank since 1996 or so. Compass sold to another bank, and thankfully they kept the same account number, and essentially the same online app.Now PNC comes along and changes account numbers, and then makes it all but impossible to find it online, where you have gone through two layers of security already. I'll be removing my money and taking it elsewhere. This bank's online banking is the worst banking experience I have had - ever."
1463,1118,PNC Bank,"The people working at PNC have no qualms about wasting your valuable time. Been trying to deposit a check from insurance company claim for almost 3 weeks, and have given up and taken to another bank that made the deposit of the same check in minutes."
1464,1118,PNC Bank,I will have to say this in regards to a mortgage PNC is the worst! Trying to get answers are impossible. One department doesn’t know what the others are doing. I have tried and so has my atty. Tried to get them to reply or provide written proof of our request and they never did. Either they don’t have or refused to comply.  Which forced me to pay more.  After they sent me a threading letter to foreclose.  Knowing I don’t have the money to sue.  I would NEVER suggest anyone to use this bank!
1465,1118,PNC Bank,"I hate PNC .. they bought BBVA..Their customer service is a joke. My account has not been right since the big switch-a-roo. The kids that are in the customer service department are so arrogant and, I really am challenged to find the words to describe them, inept comes to mind. When I have the  time I am going to take every dime I have out and put in a piggy bank."
1466,1118,PNC Bank,"My final payment for my mortgage was made on time despite considerable obstruction from PNC Bank. The bank's own records show it was received on time by wire transfer and that my mortgage was fully paid on that date; no late fee was assessed. Because of the holiday PNC didn't post the payment to my account for several days and it was reported as late to the credit agencies. I asked PNC to correct their records and retract the negative comment, they said I had to do a formal dispute. I did (with both PNC Bank and TransUnion) but PNC declined to retract the comment and TransUnion deferred to its decision. I had one late payment during the life of the loan -- three years ago when I had to choose between my mortgage payment or a funeral for my identical twin. The bank was uninterested in the circumstances and reported the late payment. That report was accurate; this one was not. My credit score dropped significantly and is affecting quoted interest rates for refinancing from other banks. PNC Bank is inflexible and won't admit its own mistakes; be careful about borrowing from them."
1467,1118,PNC Bank,"I called PNC customer service about whether a transaction would incur any transaction fee. His answer was basically to try it online yourself, and mentioned it may incur fees not now but after a few days. He was unclear about my specific transaction, and didn’t know anything about the fee schedule. Besides incompetent to help, he kept repeatedly saying “anything else to help?” to avoid the topic."
1468,1118,PNC Bank,"I have only been with this bank for a couple of months and what a mistake.it took 3 calls from abroad that cost me a lot of money, and still my issue of on line banking is not sorted.i will be sorting out another bank as soon as i get back to the US."
1469,1118,PNC Bank,"Loan got traded to PNC... My first phone call, I was hung up on... Next one I did have ""Debbie, that was helpful and followed thru... Finally got my Pin in the mail, it did not work... called customer service.. woman tried to help for 30 min... handed me off to some other rep.. that only said it would take 5-7 business days to get a ""new pin"" to even LOG ON!   I would NOT trust this bank or their SERVICE! RUN!"
1470,1118,PNC Bank,"I have NEVER been negative in my bank account until PNC took over BBVA. Duplicate transactions?! What?!Their ""Virtual Wallet"" does not show accurate available balances and will mislead you in to thinking you have more than you actually have. I once woke up to a +2300 in my account and no reasoning in the the ledger. two weeks later, I got negative -$4200. Then i see they have pulled transactions from 4 days ago that was already drawn from my account but somehow still pending? Customer service says that they have no idea why it would go negative except that the merchyants did not claim the sell until a week+ later. But i confirmed my physical ledger (Thank goodness I had a reference point) and should have had over $6000. Strangely a few hundred was added to my account (no ledger note). Now i wake up at 4 am just to check my balance because there are pending transactions that have been sitting for over a week. It horrible and stressful. I have already found another bank and will be closing all accounts in a Few days. RUN!"
1471,1118,PNC Bank,Poor customer service. Leaving Pnc after 18 years
1472,1118,PNC Bank,"The app no longer works. My user name and password keep getting locked even though I've changed it several times in the past 2 weeks. I can no longer access my mobile app despite updates, uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I've been with PNC for over 20 years and this is the 1st time I've had problems. If it continues, I will be forced to move my banking elsewhere. PNC had always been a great bank. Now I am having serious doubts with the merger and lack of access to my mobile app."
1473,1118,PNC Bank,very good bank for checking account and locker facility.
1474,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bank is beyond the worst. The supervisors are incompetent and this bank do not help customers. They will even change fraudulent checks and when you try reaching out to the fraud department, you get nothing. They just give you a number to go record your information for one of them to think about returning your call. I’ve been trying to reach out to the fraud department for the passed week now and nothing. Yesterday, around 6 PM they had another incompetent supervisor returned my call, but only to find that she did not feel like doing any work. So, she kept pretending not to hear me. This representative thought it was my telephone line that was giving troubles, when it was actually PNC piece of crap phone that was causing the interference. She called like 5 times and, I even returned her call on other phone line and she still kept pretending not to hear me. Way to go PNC!!!!"
1475,1118,PNC Bank,"I would give this bank a 0 if I could. I attempted to close my account due to getting married. The first time I called it took over an hour, they attempted to transfer funds to my new bank, cancelled the transfers, and promised me a check with remaining balance. The second time I called because I was charged a transfer cancellation fee for the money the associate tried to move and had another associate tell me the accounts were never closed and a check was not sent. They said I could not go to a bank to cash out and had to wait for the check. Two weeks later, no check and I’m still waiting for the thousands of dollars I own. I call again to get info on where the check is. They tell me that I CAN go to a branch to cash out, when I tell them that contradicted what they told me previously, they hang up on me. Call back AGAIN, tell me they don’t know, will escalate the matter. Wait on hold for 30 minutes to be transferred to another associate who tells me I have to repeat everything. No one can give me a strait answer on where the check is or if I can go to a branch. Banking with them is a complete nightmare anyone who cares about their money pick literally any other bank."
1476,1118,PNC Bank,I was a BBVA customer.  BBVA was bought out by PNC.  My BBVA debit/credit card was good until 11/25.  PNC sent me a new debit card which I had not activated.  Without warning they canceled my credit card.  When I tried to enable the card they sent me I was told that it was closed.  They changed the teller hours so that now I will need to take off from work to access a branch office.  Now accounts that were paid by my BBVA card are not being paid and I have no way to fix it for at least 6 business days.  I am probably going to cancel my account with this bank since they apparently don't care how their actions affect their customers.
1477,1118,PNC Bank,"I've banked with PNC for over 20 and I will be looking for another banking institution. They have changed into a big bank and no longer extend courtesies to the average personal account. Over the years they have changed my account due to updating their accounts and have not informed me of the changes until I noticed the changes made myself. Even common courtesies are not extended for dealing with the tragedies of family life. Not a bank I would recommend any longer, find another."
1478,1118,PNC Bank,"I was attracted by their HELOC rates and made an application online. A couple of issues with PNC loan processing. 1) Unresponsive loan officer. My officer mentioned the expectation of phone/email replies are in 3 days. Even so, one of my email inquiry took more than a week. 2) Ignorant loan officers. I have been in contact with two loan officers about the document feedbacks from the underwriting team. They were both unable to explain what the underwriting team is expect. Once one officer told me confidently that my revised doc is all good, but it turned to be rejected by underwriting team again. 3) Unmotivated loan officer. PNC takes zero initiative to address customer's issues. It is said that other lenders would simply solicit appropriate documents from HOA, banks, insurance agencies, etc. This bank considers these are your job. On top of that, they don't know what documents their underwriting team are looking for. Other than copy-and-paste, their loan officers know nothing.4) Mismanaged customer service phone line. I called during the line's normal business hour, about one hour until close. The line did forward my call to an operator, it turned out nobody answered the phone for 5 minutes until I hang up. Note this is AFTER the waiting for the next available representative period. It seems that it was just the operators left their jobs early."
1479,1118,PNC Bank,I have been a customer for 30 yearsThis bank has gone downhill and they are lacking customer service. They don’t answer emails.  And they do not care about their customers. This is my first negative review for anyone and also first review that I have written.
1480,1118,PNC Bank,If I could put a negative 5 I would!! Do not bank here
1481,1118,PNC Bank,"I have dealt with banks that are questionable in regards to their customer service but PNC bank is the very worst I have ever dealt with. Everything with this bank is a process beyond what I have ever experienced, no matter what transaction it is, but particularly the dispute department has no equal. No one knows what is going on and disputes are just not resolved. They never find a cause for a dispute to be resolved efficiently and/or properly. Think again before doing business with this bank. It absolutely is the worst bank I have had experience with."
1482,1118,PNC Bank,I called PNC 1-800-762-2035 twice on Wednesday 3/2/2022 with the first call at 10:09 am. On the first call the lady could not help {they were able to help me with same problem a month ago).  The 2nd time I called I spoke to same lady (same voice). I asked to speak to someone else who would help. She claimed to be a different person ( Ingrad ) and was giggling. PNC should tell their employees to not play games. Not professional.
1483,1118,PNC Bank,"Terrible bank! No help, bloated accounts, no problem solving skills, wait on hold for hours. We will divorce shortly!"
1484,1118,PNC Bank,"They had zero transition plan when they took over Compas bank which shut down my business from taking ACH transactions, their service is terrible! ecpect to wait an hour plus on the phone with them if you need to call in and change a password"
1485,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst bank EVER!PNC put a hold on my debit card for ""investigative potentially fraudulent use"". I would not have even known this if I hadnt tried to use my card. When I called customer service, I was transferred 6 different times and was on the phone over 2 hours! I was THEN informed of the hold. I spoke to Kim (the last representative I spoke to) and she lifted the hold and stated I shouldn't have anymore issues but I would have to call the next morning to have a new debit card issued. I did that, as well as paid the $25 expedited fee. I received my card on Wednesday. I had to call PNC because instead of using my same pin number, they apparently changed it. However, the representative activated the card and told me to use it as credit until the pin number arrived in the mail. Thursday evening, I got a notice my account was in low cash mode. Keep in mind, there were 3 digits in that account  ($xxx.xx). I immediately called PNC, once again. This time they informed me that the account was being closed. When I asked why, they could not give me a reason, only told me to call another number in the morning. I called that number this morning and they advised that there was nothing they could do, the account was closed and they would mail me a check of what was in my account! I told them they needed to also refund my $25 expedited fee I paid last Friday as well. I was told they will ""put in a request"" but no guarantees. I NEVER had issues with my account when it was BBVA! PNC Bank have poor customer service and no one knows what's going on. They just ""pass the buck"" STAY AWAY FROM PNC BANK!!"
1486,1118,PNC Bank,"I really hate PNC. How did I end up with this lousy bank. I did not open an account or credit card with PNC. I have a credit card with BBVA. However, I closed my credit card with BBVA May 6, 2021 and paid the entire balance. I only have one bill going to BBVA credit that is why I closed this credit card. I have no Idea that BBVA bought by PNC all of suddenNovember 2021 I have received a statement from PNC that I have a balance of $94.00. I called PNC at least 20 times. I spoke to different customer service people and they can't figure out why I have a balance. It's so frustrating, what a freaking nightmare! I even talked to their dispute department several times month of December 2021. I explained to them the entire scenario they told me that they are going to submit my dispute but then It just going into circle nobody's working on it. I wish PNC will go out on business. I HATE HATE HATE PNC!"
1487,1118,PNC Bank,Absolute trash. Do not ever use this bank. Customer service is non-existent. I have money in my account and yet my cards declined everywhere I go. Straight up hot dog water of a business.
1488,1118,PNC Bank,Tatiana helped me resolve my issue over the phone quickly and with great service. It was well appreciated.
1489,1118,PNC Bank,Worst customer service I have ever experienced.
1490,1118,PNC Bank,"The bank mailed my new card to an incorrect address. They then proceed to cancel my current card and tell me I need to wait until my new card comes in. After noticing they had my address on file incorrectly, I proceeded to change it. Now it says I need to wait 3 business before I can even request a new debit card because they need to verify the address. Yes, debit card. Not credit card. This company struggles with simple tasks and after reading the reviews I'm not even close to the only one experiencing this incompetence. This is the worst bank experience in my life! I hope they go bankrupt and the CEO is thrown in prison. DO NOT USE THIS BANK. IT'S TRASH!!!"
1491,1118,PNC Bank,"The WORST customer service of any bank I have come across. I was hung up on twice trying to help an elderly client get bank statements to go into a nursing home. As a Social service worker, it is my job to advocate and assist. The people who work for PNC need training on customer care!"
1492,1118,PNC Bank,"2nd time I walk into PNC bank foe help. 1st time i need to make a bank wire to Alamo Title. I left after waiting too long for help. In my opinion, too many employess walking around or doing other things.  Not willing to helpthe customers that are walking in.  It seems as if these employees  are too busy doing something else. So I leave to the Stone Oak location in San Antonio TX where at that location as soon as I walk in I get greeted at the door.  Associate there helps me with my wire right away. 2nd day at the 410 location PNC . I walk into   The bank there is only one customer 2 tellers no one in the drive thru. And teller from the drive thru does not acknowledge me. She simple looks back at the line inside towards me and turns back around and sits there. Soooo, I have to wait for teller to finish with his one customer until I get help. Similar situation happened 02-09-22 and 02-10-22   Now I am waiting for a new debit card. There are  2 bank associates that help customers with wires ,debit cards etc. You see one with some customers and the other on his phone. By now there is a long line for tellers and now there are two people waiting to see a bank associate. Poor customer service. At this  location On NW loop 410 San Antonio Texas 78251 Poor poor poor customer service I have to walk out again."
1493,1118,PNC Bank,"People are great but I want to do everything online. I've had multiple questions/issues, and the site is often down to conduct transactions. The mobile app is pathetic if you ever used Chase or Bank of America. Obviously, none of their executives must have to use their piece of junk software. Also, their accounts for checking, saving, etc. are confusing. I live in the DC area, so I never go into a bank since customer service across industries is atrocious."
1494,1118,PNC Bank,PNC has been my best banker for the past 12 years.  Excellent customer service.  Great rates on my PNC credit card.   Talked on the phone with Farrah Haidari who is helping me open my business bank account with PNC here in Washington DC.  Excited to build my business credit score and grow my business with the help of PNC's products & services.
1495,1118,PNC Bank,I thought BBVA was bad they say you can have an account without having a bank account but their app online I've tried talking to 11 people from their company now and no one can seem to tell me how to do it or they tell you how to do it and it's incorrect they send you passwords and the mail and all sorts of garbage off of your payments to still be late because you either have to call them in or go to one of their locations which are few and far between between BBVA and the switch over to PNC I have had five late payments which now is affected my credit by 52 points I have never had a late payment in my life and I'm not some young buck steer clear of these clowns and definitely if you are a person that took advantage of bbva's 24 months program and you're stuck with these guys find another credit card like I am pay that junk off or pay it off in cash one of the two or best yet just don't mess with them you will regret it I promise worst credit card I've ever had and I'm talking about when I was a kid and didn't have anything
1496,1118,PNC Bank,I have been a PNC customer for years.  Looking to change now.  They have closed every branch and ATM within a 40 minute drive of my home.  As of today their website is down and there is no way to contact them.  Voicemail hell said wait for line to be picked up would be over 20 minutes.  No option on website to report issues.  Worst customer service.
1497,1118,PNC Bank,"Former BBVA customer. BBVA and Once merged in 2020. After my account was switched over to PNC, I was told I could use my BBVA bank card until the PNC cards were received which they said we're on backorder, no approximate date. My account showed a card and I was told not to worry about that card because it's on backorder.Fast forward to January 31, 2022. I go to the store and can't pay for my groceries. My card has been deactivated. I call PNC and they tell me they will order a new card which will be received in about 10 days. I call and speak with multiple representatives to find out how I can access the money in my account without a debit card. The closest branch is 40+ miles away and we are in the middle of a snowstorm. PNC says there's nothing they can do. I immediately switched bank accounts and went to Capital one. This is the second time PNC has messed with my account and left me without any access to my own money. ""Too bad"" is all they can say and do. Bye!"
1498,1118,PNC Bank,Literally the worst bank in the whole world from the customer service to their late fee charges that bank is a mess they had my mom on hold for 45 minutes and then they hung up the phone after they turned her debit card off on the day she got paid so she had to wait till after work to go to the bank and talk to whoever to get them to turn the debit card back on they had no reason of why they turned it off in the first place I am telling you this is the worst bank ever and my mom has banked with them for over 20 years but hopefully today is the last day for that.
1499,1118,PNC Bank,"Would be a zero if that was an option.  An estate account which is required by the probate court, is being bled dry with stupid service fees!  PNC is worst bank ever.Hope you never had your loved banking institution taken over by the greedy vultures!!!!!I told the customer service rep if she was aware how poorly the banks reviews were.....had no clue!  All adds up doesn't it.  Clueless!!"
1500,1118,PNC Bank,"I am a former BBVA customer. The BBVA website and smartphone app were second to none. They worked great and PNC should have used it. PNC's mobile and online banking look and operate like you would expect from 2002, not 2022. For example, when viewing your transactions on their website, you have the option to view only the most recent or ALL OF THEM. Every time I try to view something from outside the most recent, it takes forever to load and locks up my browser. Another example is the way they display your account balances. In addition to the normal Posted Balance and Available Balance, they have a display call Free Balance. The idea is it shows you cash flow based off what you have in the bank compared to any schedule transactions. It doesn't take into account deposits. IT IS USELESS. You can't turn it off and its the first thing you see on the smartphone app.  Today I had a small panic when logged in and the website showed a balance of $1000 in my account. When I opened the mobile app it only showed a balance of $23.58. The app shows the Free Balance by default and the site shows the Posted/Available. Want to view your account and routing number? Well, AFTER you have logged in and are looking at your account, you then have to navigate through other pages and then submit a request where they send you a code to get to view your information. Is it for security concerns that someone might steal your info?  This makes no sense as you are already logged in and are able to transfer funds and make payments without the additional steps. The data migration from BBVA to PNC did not go smoothly. My accounts, my parents', and several of my friends have all had issues. We're talking getting locked out of personal and large business accounts and having other family members' names on the wrong accounts. I tried to order some checks from a branch only to find out 3 weeks later the order was never submitted. As a former BBVA/Compass customer, I am not happy and will be looking for a new home for our money as soon as I get the time to move and update all of my accounts again."
1501,1118,PNC Bank,"Worse than Used Car Sales! Dishonest! Stay AWAY from PNC. Complaint about them to CFPB more than a review here.Review: I give PNC Zero or negative points.BBVA (now PNC) does not provide transparent and proper disclosure of fees and costs associated with mortgage refinance. PNC's claims of ""fair lending practices"" are false. PNC's disclosures are far removed and misrepresent any claims or commitments to ""good lending practices.PNC also used deceptive practices to lure us into the mortgage transaction, and conveniently ""timed"" the closing dates so that we were stuck with them and risked the lock-in date - thus forcing us to give in to PNC's fees and charges."
1502,1118,PNC Bank,"I wouldn't recommend this bank to my worst enemy.My husband was in the hospital and so I got not only 1 but a second POA --- BOTH of which they did not accept. Curious bc all of the hospitals and attorneys accepted these POA (Power of attorney.)They didn't phone me back. After my husband's passing they said that I needed the court papers , etc which might take a year ---. Fees continued to be removed each month. Pathetically frustrating and unnecessary!!!! Get you accounts switched while you're alive!!!! Huntington is the BEST!!!! Would give a 0 if I could"
1503,1118,PNC Bank,"I had banked with BBVA Compass several years. PNC bought them out. First thing PNC changed all the bank account numbers which means you have to change all details on auto withdrawals for electric bills, health insurance, etc. I went to the bank and there was 1 teller for, serious, 50 people in line. The teller was ex BBVA and told me she hated PNC and was quiting. I planned to change banks but even trying to do that is hard. They have a limit of $2000 you can transfer at one time, also you have to wait until the funds are sent(5 business days) before you can even schedule the next transfer. The web site is down much of the time at night. This is the worst bank I have ever used, or better I used before changing banks. TERRIBLE"
1504,1118,PNC Bank,"Me and my fiancé have had PNC Bank for about a month now, it's been a lovely experience, that I opened up a separate account for me. The mobile app is fantastically designed, customer service has been friendly, and professional for us, we love the branch and ATM footprint, and we love, love the low cash mode, I think it's brilliant because it gives you 24 hours before they will hit you with a $36.00 overdraft fee. We have never came across a problem with PNC so far, and don't plan too. Our local branch has the most friendliest, professional, kind, and knowledgeable staff we ever met. Everytime we have an issue, it's solved 9.5/10 immediately! We couldn't be happier with PNC Bank. We moved from DE to PA and was banking with M&T Bank, and we are closing our accounts because we are no longer in there branching footprint and PNC Bank was near our home, and we choose them as our financial institution and again we couldn't be more happier we did. We love everything about PNC!"
1505,1118,PNC Bank,My mother and I have been with PNC for over 20 yrs at 1st the bank was the best but lately I just don’t understand this bank why would u wait till midnight to about 4 a.m. or longer to do maintenance every night when people wait till midnight to see how f there money went in bank to pay their bills and then u can’t even get on ur account to see if ur paycheck went in bank that’s bad buisness these days people need their money they can’t wait till 4 a.m. or longer to be able to get on line to check their funds and u can’t even call either it’s very bad people need their money
1506,1118,PNC Bank,"Unreal that this bank is unable to fulfil the basic functions of a bank. Their app is horrible and clunky, very limited options for payment. Wait times for support are long. Staff stonewall and do not offer options. Staff appear to be unfamiliar with their own processes and services."
1507,1118,PNC Bank,Been on hold for 2 hours after waiting 30 min to speak to someone just to get transferred to I assume no one at this point.
1508,1118,PNC Bank,Terrible customer service since they hijacked my mortgage.  They screw up my escrow every year.  Impossible to get a person on the phone.  Online website is VERY user UNfriendly
1509,1118,PNC Bank,"This bank should be shut down immediately 11 years of great banking done for in a instant and absolutely no help from branches incompetence at every turn I stopped making deposits when 13000 came up gone they closed my accounts saying I had no money this is theft I was forced to open new account to get some of my money cost me a job now cause I can't show deposit from my employer because he refused to make deposits paid cash, PNC BANK I WILL SEE YOU IN COURT YOUR BANK SUCKS I HOPE YOU ARE SHUT IN TEXAS BEFORE OTHERS CAN BE ROBBED"
1510,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC has changed a lot in the 18 months and that change has been for the worse.  This is 2022 and they just started allowing internet wire transfers domestically and internationally.  The international online wire transfer system is full of flaws and PNC replies by saying we will fill out a ticket.Arrogance rules at PNC the staff acts like you should be honored that they allow you to bank with them.  I had one PNC Branch Manager tell me when I asked her about service issues, ""your questions are above my pay grade""  I closed our accounts in January of this year I wish them well."
1511,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC bought out my bank BBVA Compass. Immediately I noticed a change in customer service, waiting on hold for hours. They signed me up for overdraft protection without my consent. Then they hid a number of transactions letting them ""stack"". I checked my available balance one day on the app and it said I had $350. The next day, the PNC informed me that I was overdrawn! They subsequently charged me $36 for every charge they paid even though I had the understanding that if I didn't have the funds to cover charges that they would have been denied up front. My account is now closed. Consumer beware!!"
1512,1118,PNC Bank,Garbage company. Outrageous and unfair fee's. Sends me spam emails that are downright fraudulent. Claiming accounts are being opened in my name with NO INFORMATION to look into it. Didn't pay the bonus they were suppose to. Just not worth. They don't even take ATM fee's.
1513,1118,PNC Bank,"PNCs customer is horrible! I was on hold for an hour before I was able to speak with someone, but that person couldn’t help so they transferred me to someone else. I was on hold so long that I just hung up, their customer service is horrible in my opinion."
1514,1118,PNC Bank,Garbage bank.  These people are detestable scum.  I banked for 6-years at BBVA without a single NSF incident.  PNC bought BBVA and in less than 60-days I had $300 in NSF fees.  Closed my account.  F—k them.
1515,1118,PNC Bank,"Customer Service is non-existent. Went to the bank to ask them to send me a debit card. Received a PIN number by mail, but never received the Debit card. Customer service is unreachable by phone. After an hour of waiting, I did get an answer once on the phone- it was to the Spanish service (luckily I speak Spanish) who told me that I was probably sent over to her because they were overflowing and proceeded to put me back on hold. Attempted using Twitter PNC customer service with no answer. No idea how this bank is in business."
1516,1118,PNC Bank,"Had set up auto payments for a credit card from Chase. Payment was accepted , then denied 5 days later. PCN cannot locate the transaction even though it shows payment mad on my Chase card. Have a mortgage through PNC, my house closing in the 28th and with that, I will be moving my accounts to another bank. Also, the transition from BBVA to PNC was a nightmare, Training of employees begins at the top. I do not trust this bank to manage my accounts. If you are thinking of doing business with this bank, for your peace of mind, research and think again.  Brief version RUN!"
1517,1118,PNC Bank,What can you expect for a for-profit bank? Pro-tip: Use a Credit Union instead.
1518,1118,PNC Bank,I was with BBVA when they transitioned over to Pnc and I agree it was a total disaster first of all they didn’t have all the necessary tools for us to make transactions on the account that did not have the access to a branch or an ATM so my account why is it going negative several times the last time that it has occurred they gave me a little over two weeks close my account after I opened up a savings account now I have a savings account closed checking account and was not informed of it and less until I called I have an inheritance that is going to that account now I have to try to stop it when I asked him to give me some kind of replacement one exception due to the fact that I had no way of making a cash deposit to cover the overdraft. They informed me they didn’t know either. WHAT??
1519,1118,PNC Bank,This bank is the worst I've ever dealt with tell the CEO to go F himself
1520,1118,PNC Bank,Horrible service and careless. They gave our employee someone else’s account information then refused to correct the incorrect deposit that resulted from the error. The first employee even accused the employer of not helping the employee. Most of the people I spoke to were just plain rude.
1521,1118,PNC Bank,I was a PNC card holder for over 10 years. I recently discovered that this company has continued to give donations to congresspeople who supported the terrorists and the Big Lie after pledging they would no longer support those traitors. PNC lied and continues to support insurrectionist/traitor congressmen. I can no longer do business with a company that is a traitor to our nation.
1522,1118,PNC Bank,"This bank gets 1 star because I have to select atleast one to give a review..  WORST BANK I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF BEING WITH. HAVE BEEN WITH BBVA FOR 15 YEARS AND WILL NOW BE CLOSING BOTH ACCOUNTS WITH PNC. HORRIBLE ONLINE APP, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.  IDIOT FRAUD DETECTION. Even my pnc banker recommended I switch to bank of America. The old bbva employees can't stand pnc either.  Don't go with this bank,  you'll regret it"
1523,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been a customer at PNC for almost a year, I have there prepaid card and it's been absolutely great. Great customer service from the prepaid side, excellent card, excellent fraud protection, and always friendly service at my local branch. The PNC SmartAccess Prepaid Card has been my main account for awhile now. It's awesome for $5 a month, the card is pretty amazing, the card has Tap Pay, and a chip, I can do everything with this card like I could with a traditional standard checking account without paying a $7 monthly maintenance fee. I don't overdraft or use checks so this card is great! It's definitely my favorite bank account. :) I have 24/7 customer service, and the mobile app is great as well. I have alerts set up, I can see my transactions, and I can suspend my card if it's lost, stolen, or misplaced which I love. PNC has been a very great bank too me, I look forward getting a checking account with them in the future, but for now I love the prepaid card, and it works very well for me. I absolutely love PNC and I look forward to many, many more years with them."
1524,1118,PNC Bank,"The branch staff was fine and great, but customer service sucks. I tried reaching out for information including the regional manager and they either never got back to me or said they couldn't help. Also, they charge so many different fees that it is impossible to try and grow a small business. They only care about the bigger business as I talk to them for options for small businesses and they said they only work with long term business that are medium or larger."
1525,1118,PNC Bank,"We were selling our mother's house.  (She is 93, blind, & cannot make big financial decisions).  We wanted to open an account for her at PNC to receive the money, using my ""Durable Power of Attorney"" document.  Banker told us it would take 3 days for PNC to approve.  So I start calling then, but nobody answers the phone.  Only way to communicate is by going to the branch in-person, or by e-mail. Many back-and-forths, but after 12 days, still no approval and we are closing on the sale.  Gave up on PNC and put the money into a completely different bank instead.  Note:  we were not asking for a loan, just wanted to deposit a big chunk of money.  Discussed at closing, guess what?  The buyers, the buyers' realtor, and our realtor all were having trouble with PNC!  We had been doing business with BBVA/Compass for 20 years, with few problems, which they always worked out.  But PNC takes over and we try to open a new account, they suddenly don't want our money?  Note:  their personnel were courteous to us, but whoever makes the big decisions - like what phone system to use, how many people to hire in Legal, etc.- that doofus needs to be run off pronto."
1526,1118,PNC Bank,YOU FCK SUCK WITH YOUR BUNCH OF CROOKS 30 YEARS OF USING YOU WOULD USE YOU AGAIN LAZY MOTHER FCK PERIOD
1527,1118,PNC Bank,"I first had to wait 30 minutes for a live person to even answer my call which was frustrating enough. When I finally do, the woman who answers has no clue what she's talking about and tries to transfer me over to someone else saying, ""Yea I'll transfer you to someone else just give me a couple of minutes."" I am currently still on the phone and it has now been an hour since she said that to me. The customer service is overall atrocious. All you do is wait for ages for the person to answer to be clueless as to what's going on. Honestly a waste of time"
1528,1118,PNC Bank,I'm not even a customer but trying to get ahold of any live person working for this company is a nightmare of endlessly looping automated messages that never actually deliver you to a person. I swear they do this to make you hang up in frustration.
1529,1118,PNC Bank,This is the worst bank I have ever dealt with. No one knows what they are talking about. My car was totaled and it has taken 2 months for my insurance company to be able to get just the letter of guarantee. This bank would not send it over to my insurance company. Said it has to come from insurance company. Ummm no. The letter of guarantee comes from the lean holder. It has taken this long to get that letter over to my insurance company after many requests and myself going into a branch where no one knew their left from their right. And then they had the nerve to hit me with a late fee in my payment. Customer service is horrible. Wait and hold times are ridiculous. Will never use this so called financial institution ever again. And my car is still not paid off from my insurance company because the letter of guarantee was not emailed over until 12/28. But my insurance company has been requesting this letter since 10/28/2021. So 2 months for Kayla to send it over. That’s just absolutely ridiculous.
1530,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC acquisition and transition of BBVA/Compass was a total disaster.  Customer service is belligerent, mistakes are constantly occurring.  I am a current customer, unfortunately, looking for a new bank.  If you want a good bank, do not choose PNC...they are a mess and worse yet, don't care."
1531,1118,PNC Bank,"Summary: just pick another bank. The former BBVA tellers are great and I have no qualms with them, but the call center is abysmal. You'll get very familiar with the hold music and running around in circles.First issue happened after they acquired BBVA. They sent me a new card and boasted about my password and username staying the same, but they didn't mention my PIN changed. So I got locked out when I tried making a purchase. Because it was the evening, I had to wait until the next business day to get help, and they unlocked my account then.Few weeks later, I needed to make an urgent Zelle payment. When I tried doing the payment, they locked my account again and wouldn't process the transaction. They gave zero reason why. So I went to the bank and asked for help. I had wonderful service from the teller, but all she could do was tell me to call the help line with her there, so I did. After waiting for 30 minutes they answered, only to put me on hold again for another 30 minutes. When they finally answered, they told me ""a branch member has to call."" They wouldn't let me hand the phone to the branch member right there, so she had to call the same help line and wait an outlandishly long time. Major red flag is that the tellers have the same help line as the customers.When they finally answered her, after waiting a similar amount of time, they told her that I needed to call them and not her. I left because I needed to be at work, but I called again later. Luckily, I only needed to wait 10 minutes before anyone answered. Unfortunately, they took my information, said they'd put me on hold, and hung on me. So I called again and waited another 10 minutes. Rather than helping me, like you think customer service would do, they told me a branch member needed to call and then lied to me about how the branch member that I saw call them never called. Immediately after the call, I made a new account at another bank."
1532,1118,PNC Bank,"Too much spam, loooong waits on the phone for support"
1533,1118,PNC Bank,"The customer service for this bank used to be pretty good, better than most.  Then somebody in their hierarchy got the bright idea of merging with another bank, and the customer service went down the toilet.  It appears they bit off far more than they can chew- now routine holds of 30-45 minutes before anyone answers the phone is the norm.   Sad to see this bank crumble into such a poor state of operation."
1534,1118,PNC Bank,"terrible customer service, wait times are ridiculous.  Minimal staff in the bank increasing wait times.  Stay away from this bank, too many other options."
1535,1118,PNC Bank,This is a terrible banking company.  When you call it’s 20 min or more. I have yet to speak with someone. Wish BBVA was still here.
1536,1118,PNC Bank,"Customer service for PNC online banking is atrocious. When I called their main line with inquiries concerning my checking, the voice command claimed that the level was excessive and that I would have to wait for more than 20 minutes. I was on wait for about an hour the two times I called, and when you finally get through to customer care, the employee agent kept saying they can't hear you and hanging up."
1537,1118,PNC Bank,"Utter garbage! Called customer service twice and after getting through their garbage automated system; the phone rang for 3 minutes straight and the second time they straight up hung up one me! This malice lack of customer service and support is the exact reason why we'll be switching banks! Do not bank with these people for they are not reliable! I had much better customer service when it was just BBVA! Not to mention in the beginning of this transition, we couldn't see our account for over a week. And now with this latest debacle, the hits just keep on coming. PNC doesn't possess the customer service or the skills to attend to your banking needs!"
1538,1118,PNC Bank,"This is absolute worst, awful,terrible (name your adjective) bank I have ever dealt with in my 48 years on this earth. I should have left when they acquired BBVA. That whole transition was a cluster. I am sitting here right now listening to my phone ring. nobody answers. I am about a squirrels nut hair away from taking ALL my cash and credit lines...ALL of it away!Worst Bank EVER!DO NOT BANK HERE!"
1539,1118,PNC Bank,"Absolute worst bank I have ever done business with! Run away! Don’t do it! I applied for a loan and was given a quick check loan, never seen/signed paperwork was promised my requested due date, received paperwork in mail with a completely different due dat, called to have it changed, you have to make your first payment before you can change the date, but there are many rules to change the date, written, request  cannot be more than 20 days from the current due date, but takes 7 days to process the request that may or may not be approved. Escalated to someone who could not help me but kept putting me on hold to talk to the person that can but would not allow me to speak to that person. A simple date change has turned into an ongoing ordeal. I’m canceling my checking that I just started, looking for another bank to refinance my brand new loan and pay the penalty (that I’m no aware the amount is bc I never signed or received paperwork) just to wipe my hands clean of this bank!!!"
1540,1118,PNC Bank,"This has to be the worst bank in banking when it comes to customer service!! I can deposit a mobile deposit into my credit Union and receive funds in 2 hours ! And PNC can’t even transfer from one PNC account to another with a check without holding it for 1 business day! The bank statements are hardly ever available! And I could go on and on, save yourself the headache and do not Bank here! If I didn’t have 25 business account transferred when they bought out my original bank ! I’d shut them all down!"
1541,1118,PNC Bank,"This is one of the wrost banks ever. They bought out BBVA Compass and I have had nothing but troubles. Online backing access was giving to someone else, Did not cash a check a a car I bought now having to deal with the Car company to get it fixed. PCN was to write a letter to me and the Car Company and did not. Upper management was to call me me back within 2 hours and it has been 5 days. I had to call. They have no clue. Custmor service is very poor. I don't have a million dollars but the money I do have is going to be moved to a back that cares about the people that keeps them in business"
1542,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst financial institution I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). First, Simple was closed by BBVA then BBVA was acquired by PNC.. Simple was AN AMAZING banking experience and it was truly a sad day when it shut down. BBVA was a mediocre experience and competent but nothing compared to the simplicity of.. well Simple. Now we all get thrown in to this pathetic excuse of a bank with the most useless mobile app and unfriendly and unhelpful and untimely customer service via chat, email or phone. Clunky experience quite literally with every facet of this poor excuse for a bank. BBVA obviously didn't care to tell their customers that they were going to be automatically enrolled in a terrible situation and it's painful to read some of the horror stories some people have been having due to the transition. This bank should be subpoenaed to court for about 10 things including misleading their incoming 'acquired' customers. DON'T EVER USE THIS BANK, RUN FAST AND FAR AWAY FROM THIS PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A FINANCIAL ENTITY."
1543,1118,PNC Bank,"First, let me tell you I did not choose this bank. They bought out my auto loan from BBVA.  I have a FICO score of over 810 and never missed a payment or even been late. During their transfer period, I sent my payment in using our bill pay service with our bank who sent a registered mail. The check was tracked on its journey. The check was sent to the old address then forwarded to the new address then PNC held the check for almost two weeks before it finally was cashed. This made the payment appear to be late. They gave us no grace period during this transition,  charged us a late fee.  Then my husband and I both began receiving harassing phone calls & text messages sometimes 5 times a day at work and home. So we refinanced our truck with another bank 2 1/2 weeks before the next payment was due and our new bank made it clear that PNC had the check several days before the due date with the payoff amount and still we have not been credited it to our accountDON'T CHOOSE THIS BANK FOR ANY OF YOUR BANKING NEEDSThis is the worst bank I have ever dealt with"
1544,1118,PNC Bank,Worst bank ever! Took over a compass bank which I was very happy with banking at for over 3 years until this garbage bank took over. I found out they donated over a billion dollars to woke causes when they could have helped our veterans or kids with cancer or the homeless people. Poor customer service hired people overseas to answer the phones and and charge monthly fees that compass Bank didn't. Run from this bank as fast as you can!
1545,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could give PN c's customer service 0 stars I would.  I have been a member of PNC since they were national city.My account has been hacked several times in the past few days and their customer service is completely unreachable!  I've tried using their call return service, waiting on hold,  Connecting with the online chat, No one ever answers and yet they act like they're going to but the call wait time never goes down from 20 minutes.PNC really needs to get their act together."
1546,1118,PNC Bank,"By far THE WORST bank I have ever came across in my entire life. LET ME TELL Ya all my story. I was. Bbva customer before they switched to this piece of crAp of a business bank, had I known they were converting I would have never opened an account. Long story short I dispute something making my account negative 200 dollars to be told my info never got transferred from bbv so basically screw me and have to stay with negative 200 account that wasn’t my fault abs was nothing but nsf charges that I shouldn’t have had to begin with. So dealing with the phone customer service gof no where and going to the branch was even worse. Finally after weeks of back and forth I got my account down to only negative 92 dollars and 2 days to pay or they were closing my account and not to mention umm after I was given the same dispute 2 times of credit they sent me a letter sAyin the determination of that dispute stuck so I was gonna be negative 174 for a dispute I already won with bbva but they don’t no what they were doin so now they try to make me Account they closed and me have tk pay all this money for something that had nothin to do with them like they told me so now I’m goin to collections for something before they switched but they just want money from me, righr and giving me 2 days to pay a negative balance that I should have never had to pay or beenNegative for I should have been able to start fresh with them since umm it wasn’t there bank and they had no info. That’s fine close the account I’ll be damned if they think I’m gonna be in collections with them after all that bullcrap For a sh!tty ass bank the customer service don’t know shiz In both the branch Andover the phone they should all be ashamed of them selves. Trying to over charge accounts and make upShiz s they go but don’t remember what they tell customers cuz they are hypocrites. Horrible bank to bank from.  Little knowledge and customer service ethic is what y’all need until then y’all be careful bankin with the crooks and pay attention to any thing in ur account they will sneak and steal money from you.pay attention"
1547,1118,PNC Bank,This bank is very slow for opening account. They have to call their headquarters for everything.
1548,1118,PNC Bank,"My elderly parents are going through hell with this bank.  They have gone to the branches, made phone calls and have documented their payments and correspondence for months now.  Today they received a packet that PNC is going to foreclose on their home.  A home they have lived in for over 30 years now.  They have never been late on a mortgage their whole adult lives.   We have threatened to call the news.  PNC doesn't care, they have the payments........Now we are seeking an attorney.   THIS BANK SUCKS.  The stress over BBVA selling their mortage out to PNC is making my parents sick.  WE NEED Answers today.  Any suggestions?"
1549,1118,PNC Bank,I'm sitting on hold going on an hour now. Forced to join this bank as a former BBVA customer. I can neither log into my online account nor can I download quickbooks. I have two business and one personal account with them and dealing with the change has become my new part time job. RUN! This bank is HORRIBLE!
1550,1118,PNC Bank,Hate to give it one star can I give it a negative 10? Can’t even explain how bad the new PNC change has been. What was once a great bank is not a place worth anything. Time to move on .
1551,1118,PNC Bank,They closed my account today well apparently they closed it a week ago but I was not even informed of it my account had my direct deposit coming to it they said they can close an account any time which is so terrible because I’ve been banking with them for a little while now . I was constantly getting mixed messages from representatives saying I can re activate it and that I can’t like what kind of unprofessional mess is this where u just close a account that has a steady stream on income coming into it … I will honestly discourage any one wanting to bank with PNC it has already been a trying time and to now not have access to my money being retired military is literally the worst thing ever … so disappointed they get away with treating people this way !! And not to mention there’s been many months where my money would just disappear and I would never get it back and they would say something about pending transactions and that should have been my sign to leave then so I stop using the card for purchases and just took money out so they couldn’t say that anymore and now this they just close my account so terrible
1552,1118,PNC Bank,The transition had been terrible from bbva. It take me hours each month to pay my car loan.  I don't have the time to do this with them every month.  I'm ready to trade in my car just to get away from PNC.
1553,1118,PNC Bank,move your money somewhere elsethis place is horrible
1554,1118,PNC Bank,"Absolutely the worst service I've experienced.  I was trying to make extra ""principal only"" payments to be able to pay off my car sooner.  The customer service rep advised me to mail a check because processing an extra payment on their portal doesn't allow ""principal only"" options.So, I took her advice and mailed a check, notating on the check ""principal only payment,"" as well as wrapping the check into a regular size piece of paper that also stated in large black sharpie....""PRINCIPAL PAYMENT ONLY"".  I mailed the second check the next month and did the same.I logged onto my account and of course neither payment was processed as Principal Only.I called, because they don't have a chat option of course, to get help fixing it.  The gentleman assured me he would back out the payments and have them applied correctly.  He did this, and then I get a letter in the mail suggesting I stopped making payments on my loan and that I still owed them money.  I ignored those letters, assuming it was automatically generated, idiotic or not, by their system.  I was right.I then mailed a 3rd extra payment in the same manner as before.  Again, not applied correctly.I was so irritated by their incompetence, I scraped together the money and just paid off my car right then and there online. I don't understand how their people are so incompetent and their processes are so antiquated, but I am certain of one thing.  I will never do business with PNC again, and I will tell anyone who will listen about my terrible experience with them.Prior to all of this, I had a name change and was trying to get information about how to change my name on their records.  I was quickly told I would have to go to a local branch to get that completed.  The Rep obviously didn't bother to look at the State where I live.  If she had, she would have noticed that there isn't a PNC Bank in the entire State.  So lazy!  Instead of giving me all the options, she just tells me to go to the local branch. Eventually, they sent me the forms I needed as well as a fax number to send them back to.I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH PNC AGAIN.  What a relief to be done with them!!  Happy Holidays to ME!"
1555,1118,PNC Bank,
1556,1118,PNC Bank,"I payed off my auto loan and should have received a title or Lien Release Letter but never did receive one. When I called, they told me that it was mailed to my previous address because the mailing department was never updated but it was never sent to my previous address either. No one from the customer service knew what happened to my mail. then they asked me to file for a secondary Lien Release Letter application with set me back 30$ for a mistake that they made"
1557,1118,PNC Bank,"No! I never opened an account at PNC, they took over the GOOD bank that I was using. Since then, I've been trying to get in to see them and close my account. Today is my 4th attempt and I've been in line (in my car waiting because they make you use their digital check in) since 10:30am. No idea how long I'll be waiting but I'm staying until it's done. This is their business model and we are just numbers - otherwise they'd be more accessible to us. I never signed up for this, and I am SO DONE. ZERO STARS.**edited to update**After waiting in my car for well over an hour, I decided to go in and raise a little hell. Incredulously, the banker was sitting in an empty office while I sat waiting outside for my turn to see her. I almost lost it. I did get a little loud, and the teller apologized saying they were short handed (which is true every time I've gone into that bank. That poor girl is always the only person working - running the counter AND the drive thru.) I'm sure they wanted to shut me up asap so the banker saw me quickly and finally closed my account. Run away. You'll have better service, have the ability to see your banker face to face instead of digitally logging in and waiting in your car, and also be treated like a human being - at any other bank in the area.12/8/21 The saga continues...Today I received a bill from PNC, a $35.00 fee listed as an EARLY CLOSURE FEE!  Early my !!$*#@! It took weeks for me to actually get in to see the banker and close this account.  I will NOT be paying this bill.  I can't stress this enough - YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH THIS ESTABLISHMENT."
1558,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC should have moved over to BBVA's way of doing business. BBVA was very easy to work with and their customer support was great. Now we are stuck with new account numbers, no checks and absolutely terrible customer service.I agree with the other reviews Run Away as fast as you can."
1559,1118,PNC Bank,"As former BBVA customers, we've been trying to escape PNC for over a month. After being denied access to any of our money for weeks, we finally were able to switch to another bank in order to just pay our bills. But now they keep finding reasons to not shut down our PNC account. Like pending credits in the account that no one can identify, etc. PLEASE LET US GO :/"
1560,1118,PNC Bank,"RUN. JUST RUN!  As a former BBVA customer forced into this unholy alliance with PNC, Here is what I found. SERVICE CHARGE, SERVICE CHARGE AND MOOORRREE service charges coming our way in April.I was flat out LIED  to about no account numbers changing.  They all changed. I was LIED TO about external transfers remaining the same. NOPE. I can no longer transfer money to ANYONE, not even INSIDE the bank. The bank does not return my phone calls. They will start also charging monthly fees come April. If not sooner. AVOID THIS BANK AT ALL COSTS. What a cluster. Customer service is NON responsive and they never address any of your concerns. I am back to mailing a check for my house payment since they severed the EFT I had set up. A bank run by morons! Bank ANYWHERE ELSE!!! They hide behind voicemail and email and do not have the decency to call you back."
1561,1118,PNC Bank,"I'm another BBVA customer who was transferred to PNC recently.  I went to PNC's walk-in office to withdraw $1,100.  You don't deal with a person directly.  You withdraw the money from an ATM with a monitor screen.  My limit was $500 so I had to wait for the 'virtual teller' to appear on the monitor and eventually approve the transaction.  You have to talk to the virtual teller on a phone handset with a ridiculously short phone cord.  The whole ordeal took over 20 minutes to withdraw my money.  I also had to insert my ID into the machine twice so it could scan the front and back.  A fellow customer and I were commiserating over the convoluted processes in place (he finally got tired of the slow service and left).  I was overheard complaining by PNC's employee on site and was told PNC had a drive through with actual tellers across town.  BTW, the PNC employee one site only tells you how to operate the ATM.  I'm switching banks due to the inconvenience."
1562,1118,PNC Bank,"As a BBVA customer, I was forced to become a PNC Bank customer after they took over. I can honestly say that PNC is by far the absolute WORST bank I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with, and I have done business with a lot of banks in my lifetime, as well as worked for a few. Not only do the employees of PNC simply not give a crap, but PNC also seems to have some of the worst systems I have ever seen as well. Going from BBVA to this nightmare bank has been an awful experience. FYI...don't use the debit card lock feature if you might possibly want to unlock the card at night during one of their weekly system updates. Not only does the lock/unlock option disappear for 2-3 hours during these system updates (PNC confirmed this has been a long-known issue by them), leaving you unable to use your debit card if it was locked prior to the update beginning, they also conveniently don't offer any sort of customer support during the overnight hours either. Additionally, I can't even begin to tell you how many issues I have run into trying to utilize their online banking system. In fact, as I write this review, their online banking system is completely down. I cannot for the life of me, fathom why anyone would choose to do business with these clowns. How is this bank still in business? On top of all of this, they also have the audacity to take my once free small business checking account I had with BBVA, and now force me to start paying a monthly fee for it. They have another thing coming if they think I will ever pay a single damn dime for a vastly inferior product than what BBVA offered for free."
1563,1118,PNC Bank,"I needed a copy of a check written on my BBVA account 10 months ago. I tried to get it online at my new PNC account. The site said the check was too old and I had to go to the bank. I did. The teller didn't know how to get it so she called HQ. They didn't know either. It took 5 days to get a fax copy. Then, five days after that, they sent a package of all checks cleared that month to only my husband.My husband is beginning to have some real cognitive issues so I got BBVA to alert me any time he withdrew more than $500 from the bank. PNC can't do that. They can alert me to all kinds of nonsense but not that.You cannot walk into the bank and even hope to see a banker. You must make an appointment. That is pretty much hidden on the web site. When I tried on the phone app, I got a message saying I had to go to the bank to make the appointment. In the bank they have a sign at the entrance extolling their virtues and it has a QR code in the lower left hand corner, just inches above the floor, which you can scan to make an appointment. I tried three times and each time I got a request to install a Dasher app.They aren't even open part of Saturday so that we can remove our names from our son's account."
1564,1118,PNC Bank,"I was a customer before i worked here. That was all it took for me to take my banking elsewhere.They hire people even though they are not allowed per FDIC guidelines. (Any crime of dishonesty bars you from employment at a bank)PNC tries to hard to be woke, they do not care about any BBVA acquired members. They lied in the news about it-as an internal employee pet me set the record straight Nothing they as going according to their acquisition plan. They hadnt done any research prior to figure out where members were located. Direct deposits didnt work, etc even though PNC said it would. Even after it failed they still spun their PR web of lies.Managers are threatening, condescending and rude. One high up joked about workers needing yo make sure they are always camera ready by having their wigs on and teeth in. Her name was Cora and she was horrible, egocentric, and surprisingly thought pretending to be ghetto would make her relatable.Management wants to brag about themselves and not help new employees. Trust that most of the people at the call center are severely under trained. Would you want workers handling all your sensitive info that have been arrested for theft?!Anyway find any other bank PNC cant even handle getting equipment returned. It took me 3 weeks and eventually having to stop playing so nice to get a response.I was told to just get a free box at either fed ex or usps to ship back-ya know the kind that cost over 20 bucks. Yeah sure they will give me one for free!!Markisha im looking at you because you lied about that for sure!"
1565,1118,PNC Bank,They paid my last year's taxes (or so they say) when I already paid them. Now they are billing me 725 a month on top of my mortgage.  Sent them the canceled checks to prove that I paid the taxes not them.  Called dozens of times with hours upon hours of wait time and STILL not resolved. They are still charging me an extra 725 a month.  What crooks.
1566,1118,PNC Bank,Slow.  Two cars.  Waited 25 minutes.  Still in line  No greeting.  I hate them so much.
1567,1118,PNC Bank,Absolutely horrendous. Cannot transfer money internationally through any service or through online banking. I live abroad as I'm in grad school in the UK and to transfer money to my account here I would have to go into a PNC branch to do this. HOW CAN I DO THAT IF I'M ABROAD?! Then if you want to call internationally it is charged to you. There are no other options to contact customer service besides a phone call. PNC bought out the bank I've been with for 20 years last month and it's the worst thing to happen to my money. Do NOT open an account with them.
1568,1118,PNC Bank,BBVA credit customer trying to get online account set up.....thought BBVA was poor.....PNC is pathetic!  Three times I have tried to reach customer service.....after 25 min wait each time they do not have the answer then I get timed out to be thrown back into the 25 min queue.  Really?!?!?!? Do these bank execs actually expect to retain customers?
1569,1118,PNC Bank,"I thought BBVA was bad- and they were- but I’ve never seen a merger result in such bad outcomes and service. My husband and I had multiple accounts and all linkages to the accounts were broken (taking weeks for them to fix) and we were both signatures on BBVA accounts and after the merger, only he could have access to the accounts. These issues coupled with phone systems that hang up on you, agents that are not set up to actually fix anything and bank personnel who are equally powerless to help, have earned the honor of the WORST POSSIBLE COMPANY TO DO BUSINESS WITH. Will quickly be moving to another bank. Wow, never expected service processes could be so bad!"
1570,1118,PNC Bank,"WARNING!!! DO NOT BANK WITH PNC!!! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. PNC and BBVA are absolutely horrendous banks to deal with. They made a (an admitted) MISTAKE and froze my bank accounts. After 2 months of nearly daily emails and international phone calls, they are yet to unfreeze my accounts. They have no explanation and simply keep leading me on to think it will happen tomorrow or next week. I've had no access to my money for 2 months but luckily I also bank with another(much better) bank so I'm able to survive. I can't imagine what I would do if I needed my money that's locked up with PNC to pay for my mortgage, car payments, and most importantly food for my family. PNC are an absolute disgrace! Their team members even agree with me that the account was wrongfully frozen but won't take the measures to fix it within an acceptable time frame. I've been specifically dealing with a guy a who is supposedly ""high up"" in the rankings but is completely full of it. He's assured me he would take care of this as soon as possible and that unfreezing an account typically takes 3-5 days max. Hmmmm... 1 month later after being assigned to him and I'm still being fed a bunch of BS with no results. I'm writing this review to inform others so that no one else will have to go through what I'm dealing with now. It's horrendous and no one should wrongfully be kept from their own money. Save yourself the headache of dealing with a horrible bank and go somewhere else."
1571,1118,PNC Bank,"Absolutely terrible customer service. I spent three hours either on hold or speaking to three customer service reps. None of them helped me. I was told by two that an investigation would be opened, but it never was. The third rep listened to my issue and without warning, put me back in the phone cue. A week later I called my branch manager who helped me. Don’t waste your time with customer service. They are of no service at all! I also completed an on-line survey, but no one called me back. I miss BBVA. I was part of the recent conversion."
1572,1118,PNC Bank,"I was at the branch in the Pittsburgh Mills complex.I walked in to deposit 1 check, but there 10 waiting in line for you cashiers.  That doesn't count the number of cars in the drive thru.  There was 1 office person waiting on some people.  Father and son left after waiting for sometime, because no other office personal were available.  This is 2pm in the afternoon.  Can't wait to change banks!  The cashiers did a excellent waiting on people.  I have been at other offices where the office personal couldn't get anything right!"
1573,1118,PNC Bank,"I agree with all the 1-star reviews but there should be a 0 star for this pathetically poor customer service. Not going to waste my time detailing my experience because it's already been noted by others. I was a BBVA customer for over 20 years. I'm leaving PNC ASAP. They really, really, really SUCK. They could start improving by hiring people who speak English. I don't speak Spanish or Spanglish."
1574,1118,PNC Bank,"I would like to give them 0 stars.  They suck!  I have been hung up on, multiple transfers, 0 help!  We are going to try 1 more time and if we can't get help then we will change banks.  Worthless customer service!!!!!!!"
1575,1118,PNC Bank,"This bank has horrid policies. I was in the BBVA transition, as well as the company I work for. I get paid once a month and even though my employer banks with PNC, I still have to wait 2 to 3 days for my payroll check to clear.. what a racket. I can cash my check immediately.. for a fee! Are you freakin kidding me? You're going to charge me to put my money in my account? The ladies at my branch are courteous but their hands are tied on policy so we are all pretty much screwed."
1576,1118,PNC Bank,Terrible / null customer service. BBVA was so much better. It takes hours to talk to someone.
1577,1118,PNC Bank,"My apartment complex does not take electronic payments, only checks and money orders, so I am pretty much forced to live in the dark ages where I still need checks. I called PNC on October 22nd and after talking to 2 different people because the first one could not be of assistance for whatever reason, PNC CLAIMED they sent me out a box of checks on September 23rd. They then informed me I should receive them in 7 to 10 business days. WTH ?? It had been a month and yet I would receive them in 7 to 10 business days??? Then they informed me that I could re-order them and pay a fee. Why should I have to pay a fee? I didn't chose to be their customer. I did not have time to wait for checks to come in, nor did I really want to order an entire box from them on my dime since I was planning on switching banks asap due to the horrible customer service I just experienced and the hour of my life I just wasted being on the phone with them. I went to my nearest branch which was formerly a BBVA branch that still maintained the BBVA staff (who actually know what customer service is) to get a temp check so I could pay my rent. I explained what  PNC customer service said about my checks being mailed out on September 23rd to the teller and he looked into it. PNC NEVER mailed out any checks. As soon as I finished there, I went home and opened an account online with Frost. Their customer service is AMAZING! I get a live person every time I call without ever having to wait for more than 5 minutes or having to select 101 options on an automated system. The best part about Frost is they actually know what they are talking about and are more than happy to help you. I can happily say that I closed out all 3 of my PNC accounts yesterday and paid off the credit card that I had though them. Good riddance!"
1578,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst customer experience ever!  We have a commercial account with PNC and never had issues with our previous bank BBVA. Unfortunately, BBVA was recently purchased by PNC. It takes agents over 4 hours to pick up the phone and when they do they transfer you to a different department that never picks up. Day after day it is the same story.  I spend over 5 hours on phone cues with PNC several times a week trying to reach someone who can help.  We are still not fully set up after 4 weeks of trying.  It is impossible to run a business this way.  We are planning to move all our accounts to a regional bank but cannot until all the accounts are settled.  WE ARE TRAPPED!"
1579,1118,PNC Bank,"Same story as many others: I had an account with the Simple app, which got sold to BBVA, which got sold to PNC.   I wanted to use a smaller bank (hence why I signed up for Simple), all good things and all that.I have been trying to close this account since it was sold to BBVA and it's virtually impossible.  I literally have $0.05 in the account.  This bank actually spends the time and money to send me a statement to this effect every month.Every time I call to close, there is SOME reason or another why it cannot be done.  And good luck getting someone on the phone.  The one time I did, they literally told me I would have to call *another* number that they gave me.I'm writing this review during my 5th or 6th attempt at shutting the account down, and they were FINALLY able to do it.  I just got a notification that I'll get betting a cashier's check for $0.05."
1580,1118,PNC Bank,Total cluster at the customer service level.Mortgage dept. made a mistake. Which they admitted to but it took me several months and visits in person before I could find someone at a local branch to champion my problem and get it resolved. Very frustrating working with an organization that is in disarray and seemingly incompetent.
1581,1118,PNC Bank,I wish I could rate this bank 0 because I would. BBVA sucked but this bank is worse. I'm literally closing both of my accounts as soon as I possibly can.
1582,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC Bank is the WORST BANK I HAVE EVER USED! Horrible customer service, high maintenance fees, and most branch staff I've encountered have had nasty attitudes. I will never use this bank again."
1583,1118,PNC Bank,"WARNING:  I was unfortunate enough to be in the BBVA acquisition and cannot get out of here fast enough.  honestly it is almost as if they are trying to get us to leave.  While BBVA was an absolutely wonderful bank for 20 years, PNC could care less about customer service.  They are so disorganized and careless it is hard to believe that they are in business.  DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"
1584,1118,PNC Bank,"Been using PNC online banking for years. They messed it up so bad they had to pay me for 6 overdue fees about 3 years ago, and totally destroyed my history of payments. 'Now, after changing my credit card twice this year for fraud issues *theirs, not mine) a payment went to the wrong card number.  On the phone some female twit wouldn't get a supervisor when I requested one, and insisted i maka a payment (including fees) to reinstate the card.  I am either getting this fixed or will sue, knowing I won' break even."
1585,1118,PNC Bank,"DOUBLE ZERO‼️ Hate this Bank, I will be changing Banks. Cust Care closes at 5 Mon-Fri, closed Sat & Sun. With BBVA everything was simple. PNC IS COMPLICATED‼️ I can no longer log into my BBVA Acct, had 2 Download PNC APP.. in Which I can't get into! I called PNC Cust Serv. I was given a 800 # to call for PNC APP. Called the #, I was on hold for more then 2 hrs, then got disconnected. Very Frustrating . Not Happy! 😠 😠"
1586,1118,PNC Bank,"If you want to cash your check the day you get it, too bad for you. PNC charges a fee of usually more than $10 to access your own money. If you forgo the fee, you must wait 2-3 business days before the money is in your account. Yes, this includes checks from work. I don’t know how they even get away with this, but I absolutely wouldn’t recommend this bank."
1587,1118,PNC Bank,"This has not been a smooth conversion. No one seems to know what they are doing - I'm told one thing, only to be told by someone else no that's not correct. The people who do answer the phone have such strong accents, I couldn't understand them and I was apologizing to them!  And get this, they got upset with me and kept hanging up on me. This has truly been a nightmare for BBVA customers converting to PNC. Considering we were told about the conversion months ago, someone dropped the ball. I'm not impressed PNC and you'd better step it up or you're going to lose many customers."
1588,1118,PNC Bank,I hated BBVA because of their crappy app and horrendous customer service. Unfortunately PNC is even worse than BBVA. The app is horrible and not user friendly. I wanted to transfer my rent and electric to my landlord (also a PNC customer) only to discover that the app does not allow you to do transfers to accounts other than your accounts. POP cash is not even available on the app.I called customer service only to get a lady who knew nothing and was incredibly unprofessional. She wasn’t able to answer my questions and kept referring to internal references and reading to me what they said. I wound up being transferred to another rep to answer the questions the first rep should have been able to answer.This was my second call to customer and both times got reps who transferred me to another department. Why can’t I just get the department I need the first time without having to be transferred.Seriously considering closing my accounts and taking my business somewhere else.
1589,1118,PNC Bank,"Believe every one star review here. Our experience was just as horrific. “Sign in with your BBVA username and password…” Yeah, right. It just said to call. My 90 y/o mother had no access to her accounts and could not even see them. We waited on hold for an hour only to be told we had to go to a branch. At the branch they said a PIN had to be mailed. When we finally got that it worked but three weeks had gone by. We saw that when a CD transferred the interest rate went from 0.05% to 0.02%. Horrible to start but they cut it another 60%. Our former BBVA banker said they received zero training in systems or procedures so THEY had to call for help for almost everything including closing the CD. Then they gave us a check that has to be sent for “collection” so they can use the money for another week. Creeps! I hope the whole thing crashes and burns! I moved my business accounts to BofA in anticipation of a nightmare and I’m SO glad I did!"
1590,1118,PNC Bank,"An ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE! My Simple account was acquired by BBVA then less than a year later by PNC and it's an absolute DISASTER. I have no access to transactions from even 5 months ago and if I need to verify something, the only option is to MAIL me a copy with a 7 DAY ""processing time"". Their customer service is OUTSOURCED (their words, not mine), They send you into HOURS long queues to simply speak to a human all along telling you that your wait times 3 minutes! This seems like a mob operation to me."
1591,1118,PNC Bank,"The President  - Rahim - of Radio Nation Trucking, LLC, visited Lafayette, CO branch on South Boulder Rd and was discriminated against  A certified cashier’s check was deposited Monday morning. Instead of the check clearing the next business day they sent the check to the fraud department.  This is a business account and he visits the bank often.   They say that the policies changed when they became PNC from BBVA; however, this bank with the same employees now was acting like they did not even know me, even though I am there on a monthly basis for the past year. I believe this certified check was sent to the fraud department because I am black.  Doing business in Boulder County Colorado as a minority business owner has been great, yet the bank is still hassling me and treated me like third class citizen.Additionally, when asked about the  $88 Billion community benefits plan that PNC offers, employee did not have any knowledge of the plan.  I will be looking for another bank for my Business account."
1592,1118,PNC Bank,I was BBVA customer never received my debit card from pnc supervisor didn’t care she told if you are unhappy go to other banks
1593,1118,PNC Bank,"I was a customer of BBVA and they recently became part of PNC. Not only cannot I still not seek my trust accounts on PNC.com, no one seems to care or know how to fix the problem! I will be switching back to Wells Fargo."
1594,1118,PNC Bank,Former BBVA customersTransition a nightmare…no access to online banking…on hold for help over 1:15 minutes…never received new debit cards to replace the old. Can’t get a live person on the phone…Too big to continue to be allowed to acquire additional banks. Headed to nearest branch so I can close all my accounts.
1595,1118,PNC Bank,I am so happy I changed my banking to a new bank. I still have a retirement check that’s supposed to be deposited to My new account. I’ve done everything I am supposed to do. And last month the managed to get it right. This month it’s gone to an account already closed!!  What a debacle it’s been. I hate this bank! I had 2 accounts with them and a credit card. I was happy my new bank gave me a credit limit of 9k so I could close the other and pay it off. My minimum with BBVA was 78.00 and when I got the bill from PNC it was 108.00.  NOPE! Now if they can only get my retirement fixed for this month I will see about getting that changed too!
1596,1118,PNC Bank,"I was a very satisfied BBVA business customer that was dragged into this mess by the PNC acquisition. BBVA was a great company with great customer service. At some point, all of my customer and vendor ACH banking information disappeared. In the first few days of calling, there was no customer service at all, just a ""we're really busy"" and a click. When I finally got through (day 4), I was told ""yeah a bunch of people lost their data, too bad""...click. After another week of phone calls: an hour of waiting, a disconnect, and a redial, I finally found someone who knew what an ACH was. I was then informed that an ACH requires a ""Cash Flow Insight"" account at  $15/mo. + a transaction fee.  All along the way, I was given information that the next support person would contradict. I continued in vain because I didn't want to have to get all the banking paper work redone with my customers and vendors. Turns out ... you do. So I decided I might as well do it with a new bank with decent customer service. I have been a business owner for over 48 years and this is by far the worst financial institution I have ever dealt with...run..."
1597,1118,PNC Bank,"Have a BBVA Visa card, just trying to pay my monthly bill (which so happens to have gone up $70 in minimum payment from what BBVA was charging me.) Changed my user name weeks ago as requested, now with the new site it will not take my username, doesn't recognize my card number, my SS# or my phone number. Any live help people you can get (I've talked to 3 over 3 days) are all from 3rd world countries and can barely understand them. They are completely clueless. They all told me to set up a new online account which is not working as PNC does not recognize any of my information. Well, they sent me a gigantic monthly bill and had no trouble recognizing me then! The computer system and non-existent customer service is a complete JOKE. Well, I'm not laughing as the last guy from India told me to go to my local branch and let them figure it out. I hate this bank so bad. I'm praying so bad that I can get another card company to let me transfer this cc debt. Honestly, what utterly complete CHAOS and they are making horrible karma for themselves. I can't believe they are a business, let alone a bank!!!"
1598,1118,PNC Bank,trying to shut down my joint account with mom as she moved out of business area.   have been on the phone for hours several times.  They do not have a customer messaging application - every other bank I deal with has this and their phone service is backed up like crazy and it is only way to contact them if you do not live near a branch.   Do not do business with this bank - they are stuck in some alternate banking universe with processes and service stuck in the stone age.   this is the second account I had to close - my dad died and moving the money out for probate was a nightmare - even before this merger.
1599,1118,PNC Bank,"Time to change and move on:  I have been with the same banking institution for 30+ years (was BBVA but changed 3-4 times: Guaranty/Compass/BBVA/PNC).  Always very smooth and non invasive.  I am sick and tired of trying to get in touch with PNC, customer service or just a human being to help.  Wait on hold for 20 mins and be cut off as they answer or wait for 30 mins and then receive a ringing line that I let ring for 5 minutes hoping someone would pick up on their end so I didn't have to start all over).  Went into branch and customer service sucks......DISASTER!!!!"
1600,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC acquired my bank, BBVA, recently. The transition has been a nightmare. Fully 3 weeks after the transition, I can never get through to a representative at the headquarters. I either am disconnected, or the rep acts as if they cannot hear me and then disconnects. I have both personal and two business accounts with PNC, but the transition has only allowed me to set up online banking for the personal account. The story for the business accounts is that it may take another 2 weeks to allow online access. I told my local PNC branch that I am closing my business accounts and going elsewhere."
1601,1118,PNC Bank,"No they are not. I've been with PNC for a month or so, they lost my direct deposit and no one seems to be concerned. I started calling at 9 am on Friday, I was passed song all day until the break had closed. Unprofessional and rude customer service and they still have not found my direct deposit. These people didn't care that I would be out of a place to stay, one lady even told me to go to a shelter."
1602,1118,PNC Bank,"The BBVA change over is not going well. I spent 1 1/2 hours on the phone after the BBVA/PNC switch trying to get a pin for my new debit card. I finally reached someone who was going to send me a new PIN number. I recently received a letter telling me that my PIN number had been changed, but they did not bother to tell me what my new temporary PIN number is. I've been on hold for 45 minutes so far. I hate PNC bank."
1603,1118,PNC Bank,"Stephen King's new horror novel should be called ""The PNC Nightmare"". Former BBVA customer. I could say the service is awful, but that would lead one to believe there is actually some level of service. Two weeks have gone by, two trips to the local branch, countless phone calls, zero help. Can only see one of four accounts. Frustrating to the extreme. If you have accounts with PNC, run fast and run far."
1604,1118,PNC Bank,"We applied to PNC for a new Rental Account Checking to receive the $200 bonus in Alabama before they merged with BB&T.  Everything went through, including giving our Region's checking info to fund the account.  The next day all was canceled.  It was NOT our credit.  Still, they made a small deposit and took it back.  TWICE.  Now we get emails about our account and suggestions to get a $400 bonus."
1605,1118,PNC Bank,"Since the takeover of BBVA Bank, I have experience the worst in customer service. I still cannot access one of my accounts. When I went to the bank to try to get issues resolved I was never waited on because they had several customers needing help ahead of me, so I left after waiting about 30 minutes. I cannot recommend doing ANY business with this bank. They are totally overwhelmed with the combining of the two banks. Totally incompetent!"
1606,1118,PNC Bank,"Have been a small business customer for 2 years.  Repeated problems with accessing online system.  When phoning customer service, either 1) business number answered by personal banking, I am transferred and disconnected; 2) telephone robot indicates there is a 20 minute wait, can can me back, no call back.  Have requested to speak to supervisors, never connected.I phoned the corp offices, received a call back, was promised a tech person would contact me. Never happened."
1607,1118,PNC Bank,I reported my debit card missing.  They were suppose to block my card instead they left it open and someone found my card and spent money on it. Bought 5 google video games.  They told me to let them go through and when I’m calling them to fix the situation. They are putting me on hold and hanging up in my face.  I have COVID-19 right now. I’m miserable and I’m an independent worker. I don’t have sick days so I need every dime of my money since I’m off.  BBVA compass had awesome caring customer service representatives I hate we merged with PNC
1608,1118,PNC Bank,"HORRIBLE bank!!  I was moved over with the BBVA purchase and since that time I have receipts that do not show up in my statements, locked out of my Zelle, been in the bank and on hold with customer service well over 40 hours in the last 3 weeks.  NO HELP!!!  Everything with this bank is impossible and no one knows anything!! Switching to Wells Fargo today."
1609,1118,PNC Bank,"These guys are unprofessional, and clueless. They might as well outsource their customer service to India. It took us  12 times to call and get through to a live person, and when the unprofessional girl got on the phone, she was not only stupid, she was rude too. She got her Supervisor, who. I didn't believe she was a Supervisor, she tried to tell me something, and I cut her off, and told her I was the customer, and she needed to shut het mouth. We will be closing our accounts and finding a new bank."
1610,1118,PNC Bank,"I just dealt with the transition from BBVA to PNC. I used to pay my rent with autopay set up only using my landlord's account and routing number for their BOA account.  Now with PNC I can use bill pay for an individual, but my landlord would be sent a paper check.  Really?  Besides that PNC only uses third-party apps for transfers and with Zelle I'm limited to only $1,000 each day, meaning I'd have to pay part one day and the rest the next.  I don't want to start doing that to my landlord and I don't want to have to manually make two payments each month since you can't even set it to auto.  In this crazy world as the powers that be take control over every bit of our lives, including our personal banking, maybe all banks are going that way.  But I will no doubt be looking for a new bank now.  Really???... I can't simply transfer to Bank of America using the landlord's account and routing number?  So stupid.  I don't like to be forced to use banking apps on my phone for any part of the user experience.  Bye PNC."
1611,1118,PNC Bank,"There was a fraudulent charge on my credit/debit card. I called to report it and after many prompts it took a long time to actually speak to a live human being.  Then the replacement card so far has yet to arrive, going on 10 days now.  It's caused so many problems which are too many to type.  I would not recommend this bank."
1612,1118,PNC Bank,"I become an involuntary customer of PNC Bank when they bought out BBVA/ Compass Bank effective only 11 days ago.  Already they've lost my trust.i sincerely hope that you do not EVER need to contact PNC's customer service department!  Not only did they provide me with one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but they apparently do not have a mechanism in place to file a complaint!  Two different reps told that they were going to file a complaint “on (my) behalf”, and that someone should call me within 2-3 business days.  That was 8 days ago. Still no call. When I directly asked the 2nd rep how I could file my OWN complaint on my OWN behalf, she literally told me to go complain on Twitter!  TWITTER?!?!  Really??All I wanted to know was if a specific check had cleared that I wrote back about 6 months ago. They only have the last 90 days of statements from BBVA/Compass loaded to the PNC website, and the BBVA website is shut down.I am not kidding or exaggerating when I tell you that it took over 6 1/2 hours to get an answer.I used the chat feature on their website to message my question at 2:15 pm. They finally responded at 5:33 pm, then kept me on the chat line until 8:16 pm asking the same questions over and over, telling me they were getting a manager, then that the manager wasn’t coming, that they didn’t have access to that, then that they would fax it or mail it, but couldn’t give me online access, then that they couldn’t even do that, and I would have to go into a branch etc, etc,etc….Finally she suggested that I call their toll free number. After almost 3 hours of chatting she basically told me that I was SOL, but that she was “filing a complaint on my behalf”! I did call their toll free number and the woman who answered was very helpful and apologetic, accessed my statements from April-September and answered my question.  She also said she was filing a complaint on my behalf, which I appreciate, but she’s the one who then told me to go on Twitter to file my own complaint! We got off the phone at 8:47 pm.That’s 2:15 - 8:47 pm total time, and 5:33 - 8:46 pm that required my active participation such that I was not able to do anything else.UNACCEPTABLE!!Both reps very polite, but their sheer incompetence has me planning moving my business account to another bank after almost 20 years! Avoid this bank at all cost!!"
1613,1118,PNC Bank,"Locked out of 3 business accounts, on line help wait 25+ minutes then rude. Still locked out. Hate Wells Fargo but switching just the same."
1614,1118,PNC Bank,"I have had nothing but trouble every time I contact this bank.  I opened my auto loan through a car dealership.  All I want to do is find out my auto loan balance.  This is the 3rd time I have called. I have been transferred 3 times and had to give all pertinent information all 3 times. I've spent more than 20 minutes on hold waiting for these 3 different customer service representatives.  Even when I visit the location to pay my monthly loan payment the people at the bank are very confused on how to process the payment.  I've been a ""customer"" here for over 5 years and have never felt confident in this business."
1615,1118,PNC Bank,"Horrible Bank , very unfriendly  bank tellers that are very belligerent and rude.  I am going to have to close my bank account with this bank BBVA should have never sold out to this garbage bank I truly suspect them of misappropriating my money and I am noticing money is not adding up in my bank account when I go to the bank to question about it they have a very rude and disrespectful attitude. I truly thinking when this new bank to go over they need money disappear it seems that things are not adding up in my bank account no more"
1616,1118,PNC Bank,The BBVA transition was a complete nightmare. They will not allow me to activate their new card online and they changed my PIN number but didn’t tell me what it was so I can’t activate it at an atm either. It took me 10 different phone calls just to get past their TERRIBLE automated voice system. When i finally got to a real human they were no help at all and transferred me to more automated systems. I’ve made at least 50 phone calls to them and NONE of the representatives were helpful and one of them asked me for my full social security number over the phone. DO NOT BANK WITH PNC.
1617,1118,PNC Bank,"What a crap hole of a bank.  My auto deposit from 10/22 is still not in my account.  Of course PNC is no help.  Spoke to the teller and got lied to ""it will be deposited after 10PM""...really?  What outfit takes direct deposits and holds them for 12 hours?  Called about it repeatedly, lied to every time, still don't know where my money is.  Luckily we had some money at home or s**t would be bouncing everywhere.  Customer service?  You must be kidding.  Here is is the next business week and nothing resolved."
1618,1118,PNC Bank,"What a joke...lost accounts, unable to view online banking or access anything . PNC is horrible. Weeks later, and I still can't acess all my accounts and have to actually GO INTO  their bank to make a loan payment. This means I have stand behind many upset clients,who will need hours of help each, to figure out PNC debacle.I am closing this account and never ever want to hear the name PNC again."
1619,1118,PNC Bank,

1621,1118,PNC Bank,I wish I would have read the reviews before I entrusted this bank with my money. Awful experience: too many issues to even mention. I hope they get their act together . I wish this bank better times . Thanks for the lesson!!! Switching banks for sure. To all the workers who did their best to find out what they could do yet couldn’t accomplish because they didn’t have the tools … all the best moving forward !!
1622,1118,PNC Bank,"10-22-21PNC is NOT CLIENT FACING at all! Can't reach Corporate either regarding several issues: 1) Their C/S phone systems are incompetent & keep hanging up when I'm being a loyal customer to pay early on my HELOC. Then they want to charge for using a C/S Rep. This is bogus! 2) They, in the past (very rare 1-2 times in a decade did I miss the exact due date on the HELOC - NEVER, EVER in 15 years late on the primary PNC Mortgage, in fact, am typically a month or two - or even three ahead on that!!!!!) reported me late without sending a Confirm via mail Certified so they must take it off my Credit Report, which they didn't tell me they were required to by LAW, after refusing to remove the 1-2 lates on appeal! They just want to ding my credit = nasty! Can't reach their Executive Offices! NIGHTMARES in dealing with PNC... on two loans. 3) I'd ordered the original Appraisal of my home, originated 15 years ago. They said it would take ~30 days, it's a month and 3/4 & not a sign of it yet. Calling today to track it down, yet again is over an hour of my time, I'm going to invoice them for deliberately messing me over! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. Take care of your customers, else you'll have NONE! At last got a decent C/S guy Aaron #PL6340 who tried his best, despite being a 'peon' (his term). No one else would even identify themselves professionally, no less try to help! He deserves kudos! TWO HOURS later... still on hold! I'm going to invoice them for MY VALUABLE TIME!"
1623,1118,PNC Bank,Horrible. Going through the BBVA transition as well and they are useless. Two weeks later and I still don't have access to my business accounts. Had to actually go to a branch to fill out a form! Trying to wire funds to a vendor and 8 days later the money is still not transferred! The excuse...the transfer is a large amount...a whopping $6200!! Run far and fast!
1624,1118,PNC Bank,Can't get anyone at the branch to pick up the phone. Called the 888 number and was on eternal hold. I was much happier with BBVA. JUST LOOK AT ALL THE CRAPPY REVIEWS ON HERE. They need to get their customer service #@%& together.
1625,1118,PNC Bank,"Hot garbage compared to bigger names like Chase and BofA.  Have had my checking and a credit card through them for years.  Made a SINGLE LATE PAYMENT on my credit card and, for my trouble, they slashed the limit in half and reissued me another card without letting me know the one I had in my wallet was useless.   Dinged my credit report now as it shows I'm using much more of my available credit, nice punishment.  Will be clearing out my account and switching to a non Northeast Region service provider asap!  Seems to be a pattern for this antique company."
1626,1118,PNC Bank,"Horrible customer service whether it's personal or business.  Long wait times, no one picks up a phone, one hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing."
1627,1118,PNC Bank,What the actual F_ _ k.  I have 8 business accounts with BBVA that transitioned over the PNC over a week ago and have access to only one account.  New debit cards are not activating.  I will be filing a complaint with the Federal Reserve and encourage anyone else coming here to post a review experiencing similar issues.  You can't be locked out of your banking access.  They are holding our funds hostage.
1628,1118,PNC Bank,PNC Business accounts banking accounts.  If you are using a third party software to manage  your accounting dont use PNC Bank services.  They do not offer simple banking plans for a small business.  I opened up an account just to have money in and money out and I have to use there accounting profiles and extra services to pay my suppliers and contractors.  Its a waste of time and money for me.  On the simpler of the versions they send physical checks to vendors and that takes weeks to get to the person you owe money to.  If you upgrade for a fee its still a four to five day wait.  If you take it up one more level you are nicked and timed to just to transfer money in 24 hours.  So if you are using a third party software like QB’s to manage your money this is not worth it.  You will be doing everything twice and paying for it twice.  If you dont use a third party software this might be ideal for  you but be prepared to die from a thousand cuts.  I plan on closing my accounts out at the end of the year and opening with a different bank so that I can have simple and free.  Plenty of other providers out there if you look and they do have simpler platforms for cheaper and free.  Good luck with your banking search.
1629,1118,PNC Bank,"When I purchased my car, the dealer recommended PNC as providing the best rates. I was happy. However, I later found out that I could not create an online account unless I had a checking account with PNC. Four months after I bought the car, I moved but PNC insisted I needed to go to a physical branch to change the address for authenticity. They refused to ask me 20 questions to verify who I was. Therefore for 3.5 years I received no correspondence from the bank for anything else other than marketing products. Unknowingly I underpaid  about $.56 a month so after a few months they charged a late fee, which repeatedly grew per month. Thankfully they reversed it when I called to pay off the loan early.  My biggest disappointment was that they would not provide a letter releasing me from the lien unless I paid $26 to an outside entity. Even after doing so, they refused to send me the title. A duplicate cost me $85 at the Florida DMV county clerk’s office. I will not ever deal with them again. This story did not have a happy ending. A few minor changes to their customer service department and protocols is long overdue. Not providing title after paying off the loan??? Please. That is simply unethical and bad business."
1630,1118,PNC Bank,Tried to use new PNC debit card. Pin did not work. Called all they said they could do is send me a new card. What good does a new card do me if I don’t have a pin and you won’t give me one? This merger from Compass to PNC is a debacle. Switching banks.
1631,1118,PNC Bank,BBVA customer who had my auto loan acct. Spent 3 hours on the phone with cusomer service trying to get a web account opened. No one wanted to help me repeatedly hung up on me RUDE PEOPLE no help at all.  worse curstomer service eperience... still don't have a web account DO NOT USE THIS BANK THERE ARE BETTER ONES
1632,1118,PNC Bank,"over to PNCOnce BBVA Compass switched over to PNC, my account was repetitively hacked and used by someone else for over a four-month period in which time I had four different bank cards! By the time a transaction was approved for me, I would get an alert on my phone that a fraudulent transaction had been attempted. That occurred repetitively to a point I could no longer use my account. I even froze the account at a point, and now I am one last time dealing with over drafts that weren't my transactions! PNC is a nightmare!      It offers no guidance or even ability to review my accounts so that said  transactions can be corrected. After 2 weeks I still currently have no access to my account! They told me to call back in another week to see if they could access it then, and just get me a new bank card then! This is nuts! PNC doesn't know its head from it's hind side!"
1633,1118,PNC Bank,"Was a BBVA customer. Bought by PNC transition has been miserable.Can't get transferred into my accounts for over a week. Told me they had to email me a PIN. People were nice enough but this is to big a bank to care. We ran into the same problem with them when applying for a mortgage with them last year, communication was horrible and we finally abandoned the app and appraisal and went with someone else who didn't even need the appraisal as so much is available online. I figured when I saw the buyout it would be more of the same , they didn't disappoint.Want good service GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. We will be pulling everything  ASAP."
1634,1118,PNC Bank,"I have done personal and commercial banking with BBVA Compass for 20 years and no issues.  PNC sent notifications with internet instructions about account transfers on October 12.  Nothing Works!  Calling customer support gives you a message that they cant take any customer files.  I used an internal bank number that got me transferred to support and was on hold for 30 minutes, then the phone started to ring.... for 45 mintues with no messages or answers.  This is a total train wreck.  I have not access to any of my accounts.  Do not do business with this bank"
1635,1118,PNC Bank,Have a been a Compass/BBVA  customer for 25 years.  I have never been so upset with a bank.  Not only is my personal account with them so are all our business accounts.  We can't even see our accounts online.  With payroll needed to be processed today and PNC not staying with our BBVA account numbers ADP has to have proof of new account numbers and PNC just can't be bothered to provide it.  So our employees are will be late getting paid!  Not acceptable at all.  I sat on hold for 3 hours only to be told they know there is an issue.  Then sat at the bank yesterday to be told I have faxed over the changes it could take several days.  WHAT THE HECK!!!!!!!!  Moving banks!
1636,1118,PNC Bank,"Very bad service lately. Zelle money transfer app is out of service for 3 days now. When you call 800 number you get a message ""Due to a large number of calls, we can not answer at this time. Call back later"" Seriously?Will take my business elsewhere."
1637,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been on the phone trying to resolve a problem with PNC for the past hour and 45 minutes. I have a BBVA credit card but when I try to sign into my account, a message comes up indicating that my user ID and Password cannot be used and to contact the bank. Good Luck!!! All they do is let the phone ring off the hook. After putting my phone on speaker and letting it ring for the hour and 45 minutes, Ikeesha answered. I explained the problem to her, she said I can definitely help you with this and to give her a minute.  At that point she disconnected the call. To say I am furious is an understatement! I worked in banking for 15 years and if we treated our customers in this manner we would have been out on our behind, which is where employees of PNC should be. If good old Bill Demchak was a customer off the street, I wonder just how much of this treatment would he tolerate!"
1638,1118,PNC Bank,"As a BBVA customer I set up my new account with PNC was not able to get into my banking. I called and know that there will be high call volumes due to this merge. I stayed online for 1hour and 20min. By this time it’s now cut off for the call center and my call was disconnected at 6:03pm. Not very happy with PNC, they should answer all calls that are in their que. I’ve been with BBVA for more than 15 years and have never had problems with my login to account. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH PNC!!! I will be transferring my business to another banking institution."
1639,1118,PNC Bank,It is not possible for any bank to be as dysfunction as PNC Bank.  Absolutely unbelievable how dysfunction this bank really is.  Unless you bank with this bank you will not know how bad this bank really is!
1640,1118,PNC Bank,I thought BBVA was bad. PNC bought BBVA and they transferred data and systems days before the final tax filing deadline!!?? In attempting to access my past transaction history to settle my bookkeeping before filing I have dealt with more than 10 people that all failed to help me. NOT because they don't have access to my statements but because THEY JUST DON'T CARE and/or are INCOMPETENT!
1641,1118,PNC Bank,"I was calling customer service to help set up my PIN number since BBVA transferred to them but apparently I'm not allowed to do that. I was on hold for over 40 MINUTES and right when I got to someone all they said was ""Hello?"" And when i responded saying hello back they immediately HUNG UP?!?!?!? What kind of customer service is this?! This is beyond unacceptable. All I want is to set up my PIN, is that too much to ask?"
1642,1118,PNC Bank,I'm trying to make a record of what has happened my account was attacked and your people did nothing about it till it was well past when it should have I had $19.99 taken out 75 times or more of my account you guys did not flag match what's wrong I need to know you're going to do better you've given me a new card no explanation of how this happened it doesn't make sense that many times in one day but you can't let that happen my name is James Buell I'm in Bluffton Indiana my phone number is 467-9997. 260 please call me and explain why I should not go try and find another banking system how yo prevent this from ever happening again I'm not rich I do have money in the bank I needed to be safe thank you
1643,1118,PNC Bank,NEVER AGAIN. Total rip-off. Bank charged my new business accounts $50 & $65 fees that put them in overdraft and eventually closed without my permission. No fee forgiveness for not knowing of those fees. Not the first time I have gotten aggravated by this bank’s fee policies. Don’t try to send a wire!! GLAD TO BE DONE WITH THEM.
1644,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst financial institution to deal with. Took over my mortgage in 2021 and completely screwed up my payment process because they do not have the capacity to accept electronic payments. If they purchase your loan, beware! This bank is still in the 19th century and only accept printed checks for mortgage payments from your current bank."
1645,1118,PNC Bank,"Customer service at the local PNC branch in Alexandria, VA is very terrible. Yelled at by the teller for no reason other than the fact that the person at the counter has a really bad attitude."
1646,1118,PNC Bank,"My checking account was closed for no reason. I received a letter in the mail stating the account was close but when I call the customer service phone number I'm advised the account is on hold and has not been closed yet. All my funds are in this account which leaves me with no money for bills, rent or groceries. The account was in good standing with no returns checks, transactions or overdraft fees. I have not received any information regarding my funds or what can be done. I keep getting the run around by reps and managers. I just want my money so I can move on with my life. Day 6 with no information or money and just if anyone is wondering the balance was not small at time of supposed account closure"
1647,1118,PNC Bank,I have been trying to call since 4pm it is now 5:37pm. They put you on hold for 10 minutes then they just disconnect you. I have never seen anything like this.  Terrible Terrible Terrible service!!!!! This is the Greensburg pa greengate branch. I think I will remove all my money to a bank that actually answers the phone
1648,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC IS THE WORST! My mother is suffering from Alzheimer's and as a result, had incurred a significant amount of debt. I was APPOINTED BY THE COURT to be her guardian of person and property. To stop the lawsuits and pay her creditors, I had to sell her house. PNC said, ""We don't have you listed as an authorized..."" Fine. I faxed the paperwork. Called a week later. ""We don't have any fax. What number..."" Okay. Faxed to a different number given to me by a different agent. Called a week later. ""Sir, I don't see any record of..."" This went on for several weeks. I was finally listed as an authorized representative. I said, ""The surety company needs a Freeze Letter to sell the house. Please fax it to me."" ""No, problem. We will have that for you in 1-5 business days,"" PNC replied. Then nothing. The original fax was sent on September 8, 2021. Today is September 28th and I still don't have the letter as lawyers are beating down my mother's door. This is not a fake review! My mom was a loyal customer for decades and I can say with 100% confidence, PNC IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST."
1649,1118,PNC Bank,"Went in with a check from pnc bank. they wouldn't cash it. Both hickory and granite falls nc branches. had my license in hand. Said they needed 2 forms of Id. my license picture is obviously me. Well I went out. Came back in with a copy of my birth certificate. ""We can't accept that"". Ok. So I got my social security card. ""We don't accept social security cards"" they said they need a debit card or a vehicle registration card. Didn't have either one. on top of that they said they would charge 2% of the check even though the check was already through them. Like seriously. do they expect you to light a hoop and jump through a ring of fire just to do business with them? Never in my life have I had to go through so much b.s. just to cash a check"
1650,1118,PNC Bank,"they used to be a top notch bank.  Now.... stay away.  They operate on a skeleton crew.  Any fraud transactions that used to take only days to recover your money, now take over a WEEK ... IF you ever see it again. PayPal fraud stole near $1000 from my account. PNC refused me a stipend credit offering only a dispute making wait nearly 10 days before even seeing my money again.  Leaving me with no groceries, gas, etc."
1651,1118,PNC Bank,"I have my personal checking and savings accounts with them for many years. The customer service at my branch was good (I said 'was' because this branch has no more desk service due to pandemic) but it's app is not quite user friendly. But they are not as expensive as BOA or other major banks. Usually those banks charge you fee if you do not meet their minimum balance, which is higher than PNC. So overall, I got satisfied. It's a good bank."
1652,1118,PNC Bank,"If I could give 0 stars I would. DO NOT PUT YOUR MONEY IN THIS BANK!!!!!  They'll do a review for certain transactions and hold your funds up to 30 days. I'm stuck in Canada with no money, no gas, no food with 3 dogs that I was paid to deliver. I can't get access to my funds for 30 days. I mean really?!?!?!  These dogs were due to their rightful owners 3 freaking days ago. When you call they won't tell you jack crap and noone from the department you need to talk to will call you back or tell you anything even though you have the legal right to know."
1653,1118,PNC Bank,"Stay away from this bank. They just give your money to anyone! Someone walked into a bank, up to a teller and left with all my money..signature did not match,  yet she gave him my money! Now we have to wait 90 days to get it back!! They know it's not me, they have video and signature !!! They suck!!"
1654,1118,PNC Bank,"I do not have, nor have I ever had an account with these scallywags! However, I have been receiving harassing emails from them for over a year! I have called on the phone, send snailmail letters, and sent numerous emails, telling them I don't owe them money, but they continue to harass me, and demand ""payments""! PNC Bank, is the worst of the worst! As everyone can see from their abysmal reviews!"
1655,1118,PNC Bank,"I opened a business account years ago. The only issues I had at first were with my crazy exwife stealing money out my account. PNC reversed the transactions and blocked them. But, while I was in jail fighting false allegations for over two years, all my money (about $5,000) was stolen! I wrote PNC Bank warning about the fraud. But they let it happen and just closed my account. No money was refunded and noone was held accountable. Crime paid big-time for the fraudster! I won't use this bank ever again."
1656,1118,PNC Bank,I have been with PNC for over 20 years but lately I noticed that their services are unreliable and inaccurate. I opened an account with another bank and that is when I realized how bad PNC is. Just to mention one of PNC’s strategies to confuse their costumers about actual available balance by showing pending transactions and then have them disappear and reappear days later. It is not convenient and time consuming to constantly make sure that amounts available are accurate. Often times one and the same transaction charge appears twice in pending and reduce availability balance for almost a week. I am planing on leaving PNC.
1657,1118,PNC Bank,i've been a pnc customer for over 20 years. They are the worst bank in existence. They always hassle me over transactions and constantly treat me like a criminal for deposit and withdrawals for my business. They treat you like crap and provide terrible customer service. Stick your money under your mattress before dealing with them.
1658,1118,PNC Bank,"I told customer service my payment was not showing schedule, on my bank or my pnc.com and they basically told me ""it was you just didn't see it"" literally I looked multiple times. What they should have said was ""for a brief moment it will be on a 3 tab and not the other 2""  but no they just kept saying it was there and I was lying. Now they won't refund the first payment because the second payment hasn't hit, even though I am 3 weeks ahead of my schedule payment."
1659,1118,PNC Bank,"With any other bank, the pending transactions stay until they're cleared so you can keep track of all of them and the balance at the top will reflect how much you have in your bank account. Not with PNC. You will have to mark down each and every transaction you make so you can keep correct track of them (what's the point if the bank you're banking with can't even show the correct balance?) Because some pending transactions will disappear and show up a few days later. I've run into some cases where I was dangerously close to overdrafting because the balance ""placed back"" the money for the pending transaction that had disappeared. It seems like other people have the same issue with PNC and their overdrafts/fees. If you ""opt out"" of overdraft protection, it will absolutely not matter. PNC will let the transaction go through and charge you for every single overdraft you've made. Literally have never had this issue with any other bank until I had to bank with PNC because that's pretty much one of the only banks in my area. I will be switching soon once the closing fee period has passed. I will take any other bank over this one. Other banks will not let the transaction go through if you've opted out of overdraft protection & keep correct available balances (including pending transactions that don't suddenly disappear and reappear days later) This bank is super shady and unethical. I can see they make their money by being misleading. Make sure you keep an eye on ALL of your transactions (especially if you pay for or buy a lot stuff) so you don't get hit with ridiculous overdraft fees."
1660,1118,PNC Bank,"I don’t know if anyone else has had this problem, but I keep a close eye on what I spend and how much I have in my account. On more than one occasion I have had check card purchases that show up on my account the day of purchase, but then magically disappear. When I check my balance it winds up showing a balance of more than what I know I have in my account. Then a few days or even a week later, the purchase magically reappears on my account. I seriously don’t think that it is the place of purchase that is doing this. Which makes me wonder if PNC bank does this to try to get you on overdraw charges. It doesn’t work with me, but just an f.y.i. to look out for."
1661,1118,PNC Bank,"18 year customer, identify was stolen and they were super unhelpful. Only one branch within an hour of our new home, got the new card and it doesn’t work. They blamed me stating we used the card too much that day, which is impossible when it didn’t work from the start. Definitely switching banks after 18 years."
1662,1118,PNC Bank,
1663,1118,PNC Bank,
1664,1118,PNC Bank,WORST bank ever!!! They deactivated my debit card for NO REASON over a holiday weekend when I was 2000 miles from the nearest branch and left me STRANDED with ZERO access to my own money!!!! They made NO attempt to make it right except to say they would MAIL ME A NEW CARD THAT WOULD TAKE 3-7 BUSINESS DAYS TO REACH ME!!!! Left me with NOTHING!! I am done! They are seriously the worst I have EVER experienced!!
1665,1118,PNC Bank,"I transferred $10K from Chase to PNC bank last Nov. The transaction failed for no reason and the fund DIDN""T go back to my chase account! I visited PNC and Chase bank to dispute the transaction and NONE OF THEM take responsibility! Now my money just get LOST!! The most irresponsibility bank I ever used! If you don't want lose your money, NEVER use them!!!"
1666,1118,PNC Bank,"Terrible customer service.  I called to inquire about my debit card that was supposed to be sent via expedited service, which I paid $50 for, and which I never received.  I called 4 times and 3 out of the 4 times I was disconnected.  Not one of the customer service agents bothered to return my call, I had to call back every time.  I was left on hold for over 10 minutes each time before I got disconnected.  Finally I spoke to agent #4, which I had a terrible time understanding he had a very strong accent. Terrible customer service, I cannot wait to change banks.  I do NOT recommend this bank whatsoever!  Do NOT open an account with these people!!!"
1667,1118,PNC Bank,opened account never received cards so they reissued cards so they reissued cards .Bank branch would not help.Received cards activated them by phone then went to Branch to deposit money to find accont closed and they want to hit me with 6.00 for paper statements and 15.00 for cards
1668,1118,PNC Bank,Absolutely horrendous. My account showed I had money left in it. Then when I made a purchase with money that apparently wasn't there I got hit with overdraft fees twice for a total of 70 dollars. Don't bank with pnc. They are crooks.
1669,1118,PNC Bank,Top Notch banking. Customer service is second to none. Products and service are comparable to major banking firms.
1670,1118,PNC Bank,"Pnc bank, pricegoughes its costomers with outrageous ridiculous fees, my experience, I get approximately a 100 dollar direct deposit monthly from my civil service pension, despite being a 30 plus year loyal customer they charge me a 7 dollar monthly service charge every month!...avoid this bank at all cost until\unless they fire the corporate greedmongars who are responsible for this!"
1671,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC's protocols must change as they are deplorable & indicative of an institution that does NOT value elderly customers. Specifically requiring elderly immobile customers to report to their respective branch location in person just to rename an account after the death of spouse is a dubious practice at best. Despite the next of kin presenting the Southern Pines branch a power of attorney & a copy of the death certificate the institution's legal department denied the request to change/update the account name to the surviving spouse. I asked the Bracnh Manager to call the surviving spouse on the phone & validate this request. The Branch manager was content with company policy and would not investigate the possibility of updating the account name by phone & instead required the surviving account owner to report in person to change the name.  I wanted to contact the Board of Directors to highlight  this deplorable policy & force change, but the branch manager would not provide contact information. Additionally, the branch manager (Britney McMillian) felt it was acceptable to force an elderly immobile customer to report to the Branch location in person rather than validate this request via the phone number the branch location had on file. The Board of Directors needs to be aware of these antiquated practices and force the institution to embrace technology to make the banking experience more convenient, efficient, & personable.   As such, I am forced to expose this event via this venue.  I would never recommend this banking institution."
1672,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC lies to get your business. I was searching for an account that would not allow overdrafts. I am on a small disability income. I was assured that could be done with my account. Within 2 months time they racked up over $1000 in bogus fees. I said ""F"" it and went somewhere else for banking. PNC actually has me in collections for their mistakes. AVOID at all costs."
1673,1118,PNC Bank,"I have called into the customer service number on the back of my PNC CC 3 times within the last 30 days, and I know it can't be a fluke, that each time I called the agents have been curt and uncaring, bordering on rude....I am so absolutely disappointed by this...I'm not sure if they work in an environment where they are not held accountable, but it is very sad....I have banked with PNC 10+ years now and because of the continuous poor service I have received I have opted to take my car loan and house loan business elsewhere, and I will gradually be cutting the cord with PNC Bank. Years ago customers weren't treated like this, and honestly I don't know what happened."
1674,1118,PNC Bank,Do not use PNC if you are responsible for others who cannot attend to their affairs.  And definitely move your money before your loved ones pass away.  Especially if you live in a state that does not have a branch.  PNC still thinks that everyone goes to their bank to do transactions.   And they have closed the branches where my parents lived twice - finally just gave up on the safe deposit box as it was moved twice.   They can't handle multiple accounts with the same phone number and email address. And just try changing said numbers - the system locks up and messes up.   I have been on the phone with them for hours - customer service is useless - they put you on hold and call the back office and then can't help you - wait another 24-48 hours or 5- 10 business days.   Can't wait to sever my banking relationships with them then they finally process the probate paperwork and when my mom moves to my state.  I have US bank -with multiple accounts under one computer logon - so much more obvious.  Run from this bank - if you are a  modern person who wants to do banking electronically with no hassle.
1675,1118,PNC Bank,"I don't understand why someone has to go through obstacles for their money. You stupid people running the company need to make CARD FREE access just that. How are you needing a card on file? The s*** is f****** mentally challenged. Card free should be card free. If not, change the terminology. This causes trust issues with banks. Take whatever information given to you. It's my f****** account. I should be able to have access Boo matter what. Maybe if you work on sending the card a bit quicker things can be avoided. Either way, the system needs to change."
1676,1118,PNC Bank,"Maybe it’s because I’m an old geezer and I can trace the lineage of my PNC bank account all the way back to the late 1970’s to its incarnation as WPNB and through its succession as Equibank, then Integra Bank, then National City Bank, and ultimately PNC Bank…. What started out as a checking account in a customer-friendly local bank eventually became an unimportant account to a huge corporate-friendly mega-bank with oppressive fees and marginal customer service to their private citizen account holders.  Need your missing debit card  replaced?  No problem, as long as you don’t mind a $7 fee and a 7 day wait. Lots of other banks, large and small, will send a replacement card overnight or 2nd day delivery free of charge.  Want a free checking account?  PNC has one, as long as you’re ok with not touching the $500 minimum balance. Other banks just want a monthly deposit with no minimum balance.  Want free checks?  Hey, no worries!  But only if you choose one of their top of the line accounts with a $25 monthly fee. Other banks, well…. you might see the pattern here. I could go on, but like I started out saying, I’m an old geezer. If it weren’t such a tedious process, I’d switch to another bank or a credit union. Maybe I will.  For now, I sure miss having a bank that actually appreciates all of their clients, even us locals, without whom, their executives and stockholders wouldn’t enjoy the profits from our deposits."
1677,1118,PNC Bank,"I Could give a lengthy negative review with all the Bad Experiences...After years of being with this horrible busine$$I finally "" tried"" twice in person to close account and yet Even that was a very negative experience..They would not close it ?  So now they are still trying to rip me off..Wow  How they can continue with sub par [ should be a zero star option ]  service is surprisingly..... Now i can say i was in an abusive relationship..lol"
1678,1118,PNC Bank,"Banker beware.   Do not use PNC if you want to ACH transfer to ANY brokers to trade Stock, Forex, Cryptocurrency or otherwise.  That is all."
1679,1118,PNC Bank,If I could I would rate this bank a 0. They still refuse to give me my funds back even though they knew It's know why I could have possibly done the transaction. I hope they change their practices. Just a shame
1680,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst bank ever I have been with pnc for over 2 years,Pnc does not care about their clients,I basically applied for a credit card in 2019 I get denied due to  low credit history fine,I waited for over 2 years and reapplying again I get denied again even though I have a strong credit history and credit score now, I'm not a Chase customer they're got me approved asap after I applied from them I'll close my account and move to Chase ,if you can't helping me grow why making you keep my money for?"

1682,1118,PNC Bank,I have had an account with this Branch for about 5 years the smart access account is so nice to have for a backup account I just can't get approved for a regular checking account with PNC Bank I don't know why but I can't if I could that would be my regular Bank all the time the branch in New York on 42nd I Believe by the bus station is amazing they are the nicest people ever and they don't make you feel like you have a smart access account they make you feel like you are a part of them it's great I keep that account just so I can have it for backup and maybe luckily going to the bridge and see The smiling faces of the people that always make my day so much better
1683,1118,PNC Bank,"Mobile app keeps overriding my VALID fingerprint login and requiring password.  I use this feature because I cannot remember all my unique passwords!  So once in a while I go to use my PNC mobile account on my phone, it accepts the fingerprint, but then says ""for my security"" I have to enter my password anyway.  What good is all this mobile technology if I can't use it when I need it!!  Too much security prevents access to a service, and PNC is over-doing it.  Why??  It makes their mobile service nearly useless.  I know of other banks that do not do this."
1684,1118,PNC Bank,"It's not the people—it is the whole operation, system, and policies. Please please please check other banks to compare before picking PNC, especially if you're traveling all the time. I am in the military, and it was horrendous. Ohio is my home of record, and I decided to stay loyal to PNC longer than I should.  I ALWAYS had trouble contacting them when I was stationed in Germany, Italy, Korea, even Missouri. I did not lose my PIN. It was automatically wrong. We have done this 3 times by mailing it to my Father's (home of record), therefore, had no way to get cash for a week and a half, and it was considered 'my fault.' I would have to drive from Fort Leonard Wood ' 3-hour drive' closest to PNC and get a new PIN. I would have to update my living status, so they don't close my cards every month or 3 months. I don't remember exactly, compared to other banks, it every 6 months to a year. FYI, I love USAA. So if you're planning to live on the east coast forever, and ever and ever, then go for PNC. And what's even worse, I am currently trying to close them, but they never did. I am still having issues with them after calling them that I want my checking and saving closed A MONTH AGO. I can't escape from them. I'm trying so hard, but they're making it so difficult for me. I am getting stressed FROM A BANK I'M TRYING TO GET OUT OF!!!! I even wanted to check my accounts online, but of course, they down on maintenance. (still have my credit cards. I don't use it, just keeping my credit score). Truly horrible, and I hate myself for tolerating PNC for so long."
1685,1118,PNC Bank,I went to my local PNC branch in Kokomo In and wanted to open a new account. They had 3 tellers and one at the drive up window at 4 pm. No officer or exec to be found. Went to the teller who was not talking to anyone and she says I will be with you in a min. I asked if they had an officer and she looked at me like I was from another planet. Long story is I can come back on Saturday without an appointment and open and account then. Guess what my next move was? Out the door and looking for another bank....
1686,1118,PNC Bank,"I was a customer since 2015. Was having issues paying my credit card due to COVID (3-4 month span) and explained my situation. That I’d be paying it off in full in March (taxes). They closed the credit card without my knowledge and lied about having banking locations, to where I’d be relocating."
1687,1118,PNC Bank,"I love PNC! I use there prepaid debit card. It's just like a regular checking account except NO check writing, NO overdrafting & NO mobile deposit. I love the card, PNC Bank has really stepped up there game. PNC SmartAccess is phenomenal, and the mobile app is FANTASTIC! It's easy to use and navigate. I can see incoming transactions, pending transactions, and posted transactions. I can suspend the card if it is lost or stolen. I can set up alerts on my phone, I can check my daily balance, and MORE! My money is insured, 24/7 customer service! Fraud services available! It's a checking account without the hassle. I LOVE THE CARD! It's banking made easy for me. I can go to the branch, deposit money, and withdrawal money at any time, direct deposit, and I can transfer online from external bank accounts which I LOVE!!! It's my daily card. I use it for literally everything! Day to day basis. Good job PNC!!!!!!!!!!"
1688,1118,PNC Bank,"I spoke with Casey a PNC Customer Service Manager via phone 2-26-21 for 57 minutes to be exact. Casey was rude and not helpful at all. In fact Casey solution was... “he will use my case as a training service for the fraud department” The PNC Fraud Department was/is supposed to help me with fraud that I experienced  back in December 2020. Here is my story:On 12-30-20 I checked my online account and noticed there was unusual activity. Two separate charges for a tattoo parlor in Chicago.$100$500I had my card in my possession and I don’t have any tattoos. Naturally I call PNC bank customer service # on the back of my Visa card. I got connected to the Fraud Department. The rep reviewed my account and also confirmed the unusual charges. They canceled my card and said they are going to start the Fraud procedure and the first step is canceling my card and issuing me a new one. The Fraud Department said they will refund me the 2 separate payments in the amount of $600. That refund was deposited in my account on 12-31-20 the very next day and that was it, I heard nothing more and assumed everything was taken care of.2-26-21 (2 months) later I wake up to a provisional credit reversal of 2 separate charges.$100$600I naturally call the back of my visa card like I did in December thinking I am experiencing more Fraud not knowing what “provisional credit reversal means”.I speak to Daniel who was absolutely no help so I asked if I could speak to a manager. Daniel stated he can have a manager call me back in 24 - 48 hours. I said that actually isn’t going to work for me and my situation, I would like to speak to a manager now. I was put on hold for roughly 20 minutes (I understand not upset about that, usually normal) then Daniel comes back on the line and introduces me to Casey the customer service manager of PNC.I expressed to Casey why I am confused. I stated. . .“I don’t understand why I have $600 of “provisional credit reversal” charges and what does that mean and why?Casey explained that back in December on 12-30 I reported Fraud in the amount of $600. Casey said on the 12-31 PNC deposited a credit of $600 into my account (Fraud Protection). Then Casey said the confusion is because the same day 12-30 when I called about the Fraud the Tatoo Parlor re-deposited $600 into my account. That is where I get confused and something sounds fishy at this point. So now it looks/ seems I got my Fraud money back from the Tatoo Parlor for $600 dollars on 12-30 and I got $600 deposited into my account on 12-31 by PNC and that equals $1,200.My question for Casey at this point in the conversation...1. Why would the tattoo parlor deposit A Fraud transaction back into my account?2. If my account was being investigated/ The Fraud department opened my case on 12-30 why did they not catch the Tatoo parlor deposit $600 into my account on 12-30?3. If it did in fact show I was credited back $600 why did PNC deposit another $600 into my account the very next day 12-31?4. Also why 2 months later is PNC taking $600 out of my account? That is not in my budget for February or any months to be exact.5. I said I was/ am under the impression my account was being reviewed because of Fraud back in December but why 2 months later is PNC catching this so called Tattoo parlor deposit?Casey told me I am going around in circles and there is nothing he can do except he will contact the rep who helped me in December and use this as a training service. Casey basically in my opinion stated our Fraud Department should of caught that back in December but unfortunately did not. I will be switching banks and advising anyone one and everyone to be your own advocate. Bank at PNC at your own risk in my opinion and watch out for Casey, he is just another banker guy who wants to collect a paycheck, which I am personally not interested in banking at a bank that I don’t feel safely and timely assists with my money."
1689,1118,PNC Bank,right there to take your money never there to put it back after they deny a dispute  lack of transparancy of  of what your true true balence is there pretty decent  yet thier corperate greed is sad must have mistaken them for soneone who cares ( overdraft fees have no heart for those seeking justice )  too bad so sad ...
1690,1118,PNC Bank,Bought out BBVA (company who owns Azlo) and immediate gave a 1 month notice to restricted money movement and 3 month notice to closure. Absolutely criminal.
1691,1118,PNC Bank,"-0 stars--- I have been using PNC Bank for the past 3 years Feb 16, 2021, I realized money had been fraudulently taken out of my account without my consent, being I am a senior on a fixed income, they would not credit me the $65.00 that was deposited on Feb 16th.  I only had a $81  check to my name been receiving unemployment since covid began, which left me with $16.00 and Pnc still will not refund my account, that was my water bill money, and each time I call they give me another excuse that it is going to be a 2 week 10-15 day process. Between Amazon and Pnc they are both giving me the run around, Amazon has agreed to Pay the fee but PNC has not even attempted to retrieve me funds eventhough this has been escalated to their disputeand escalation dept, and nothing has been done, my water was shut off yesterday and I dont know what to do in this situation, my next step is to call the United Way and inform them that I need help because Pnc and Amazon allowed my account to get breached because my Granddaughters haven't been able to take a decent bath because our water got shut off because PNC has not refund my money that was stolen from me, during this pandemic I am still going through hardship....Someone from PNC called me yet they still didnt credit my account and Amazon is waiting for the forms for PNC to send them. I just got another job this week working from home will not get paid until next week and I will not allow my direct deposit to go into PNC, and I would advise NO ONE TO ALLOW PNC to be trusted with their hard earned money, If they treat me like this over $65.00 imagine how they will treat you if you have a whole check in your account and something happens its to hard trying to ge back what rightfully yours, Amazon said they tried to get into my account 3-4 times from Jan-Feb yet I was never notified NO ONE Needs A UNTRUSTWORTHY BANK TO HOLD THIER MONEY, AND THEY REFUSED TO PAY MY LATE FEES SINCE MY WATER WAS CUT OFF BECAUSE OF THEIR MISTAKE AND MY LATE FEES ARE $40 AS OF TODAY...DO NOT TRUST PNC BANK TAKE THIS ADVICE FROM A OLDER GUY WHO IS TIRED OF ALLOWING BANKS LIKE PNC TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE SENIOR CITIZENS....DONT TRUST PNC WITH YOUR MONEY..."
1692,1118,PNC Bank,"Nothing special - Their brokerage department is a money looser for the customer, not PNC."
1693,1118,PNC Bank,Thanks you PNC for your Email response to the issue that I had ! I was able to speak with a phone specialist whom was nice she went over a few guidelines with me and I understand! Thanks for giving the funds back. We are living through hard times a ( virus )and you never know what a person is going through we must be nice to each other no matter what.

1694,1118,PNC Bank,
1695,1118,PNC Bank,"My family's been with PNC since it was a small local bank in the mid-atlantic all those decades ago. They have fantastic customer service and very transparent fees! I still use them even though I haven't lived near a physical bank location in the past 7 years. Never going to switch. They have refundable ATM everywhere, so why do I ever need to? I've lost my card, forgot my pin, got locked out middle-of-nowhere in foreign countries countless of times and have never ever been let down. PNC has always been with me."
1696,1118,PNC Bank,Today I called about a overdraft charge that I should not have been accessed. The customer  service rep I spoke to made a statement that got me confused.  I asked to speak to a supervisor of which was the biggest mistake. The supervisor  I spoke to was very rude her tone was very degrading and she refused my right to allow me to speak to someone else when I asked multiple times. As a customer I have the right to ask for someone else if I feel that you are not giving me good customer service and if your talking down to me. As a leader you don’t miss handled your customers. This bank gives horrible customer service and I will be leaving as a customer soon.
1697,1118,PNC Bank,Great customer service - a million times better than bank of America.  I am going to transfer all my accounts here.
1698,1118,PNC Bank,"Even though I was denied a PNC Checking, I applied for the PNC SmartAccess and instantly got accepted. (I already have a checking account with someone else!) And I was impressed with the Prepaid Smart Access. Why is it called ""prepaid"". That is far from a prepaid card. It's 100% similar to a debit card linked to a checking account. Awesome card! I could not be happier and in fact, I rather have the Smart Access card then a regular checking and savings account. The card is accepted everywhere! It even says "" Debit Visa "". The car is GREAT! 24/7 customer service, great app, and alerts are on point 100% every time. It is so far one of the BEST cards I've used. I go right in drive thru deposit and withdrawal money from the ATM or inside the branch. I have 0 complaints. I recommend the card!"
1699,1118,PNC Bank,This brick and mortar bank in Mt Washington Ohio is unfortunately NOT ADA compliant. As someone with muscular dystrophy you have struggle to open 3 sets of doors to get inside the lobby. I'm surprised because this is a newer building and they have wheelchair ramps in the parking lot but NO buttons to push to open all 3 sets of doors.
1700,1118,PNC Bank,"Called PNC 3 times in the last 2 hours.  1st time on hold for 30 minutes.  No resolution.  2nd call after being on hold and talking to someone for over and hour, I was mysteriously disconnected.  The 3d call I tell the person I need to be connected to the FRAUD department.  Instead of connecting me she takes me through the same f******* questions I went through on the other calls and despite telling her this she insists on asking anyway.  After 26 minutes (I screenshot) she tells me she will transfer me.  I ask what department and she says ""you were right...the fraud department""  No kidding.  Now my issue.  I was locked out of my account.  I answered all the security questions and end the end i was told I had to come into a branch.  Problem is I dont live in America which I told the 2nd guy who I'm pretty sure hung up on me.  He tells me nothing can be done which is bullsh*t because this same thing happened to me last year and after 5 or 6 calls someone with a modicum of intelligence figured out I was who I said I was by a series of questions.  I get security but for f**** sake...use some common sense, after all, I cant be the 1st person that has had this issue."
1701,1118,PNC Bank,I started a account. Everything they offer in advertisement was true. I even had a employee call me after the first week to see how i felt about my accounts and if i had any questions. Very professional and actually seemed like they cared. I am very pleased with my new account and all the feautures it provides.
1702,1118,PNC Bank,"Phone access is dismal First call 9 minutes on hold then hung up on2'nd call I hung up after 20 minute hold3rd call connected after 9 minutesI was told that it would 3 days before they would mail me a formThey suggested that I go to a branch and et the formOnly 2 branches in Houston, minimum 45 minute drive"
1703,1118,PNC Bank,"Firstly, let me say that the branch employees and customer service reps have tried to be helpful. Unfortunately, they are hamstrung by a bloated and incompetent infrastructure. I have been trying to wrap up my deceased uncle’s affairs with PNC for over a month now. I submitted the probate documents and, after 3 weeks, started asking the branch personnel what was happening. I was told they had to resubmit the paperwork. After that, the branch told me they hadn’t followed the proper procedure (apparently they didn’t know the proper procedure) and I would have to snail mail it to the legal department directly. Every person son in every department said “I’m sorry. This must be so frustrating, but there’s nothing I can do in this department.” So what department can help? Nobody knew. To make a long story short, I still haven’t resolved this issue. I’m sure that if all you do is let them make money by holding your money, and occasionally you write a check, you’ll be happy with PNC. But anything that involves competence and communication will leave you frustrated and angry. Want to be happy? Bank local. Interstate behemoths like PNC are too bloated to provide actual customer service. And as an aside, if you call “retail escalation” it won’t get any better. It appears that their training simply involves listening patiently and then telling you that there’s nothing they can do."
1704,1118,PNC Bank,"I give PNC a minus zero score   Why?  My husband passed away 4 years ago.  Prior to his death, I co signed for what I thought was a loan.  When he passed away, I paid faithfully for 3 years $500 a month for the loan.  The amount of the loan never decreased instead it increased. I learned after numerous phone calls to PNC it was not loan it was a credit card.  Instead of notifying me, they sent e mails to my late husbands work account.  They set up a payment plan to be paid on the 20th of the month.  It's automatically taken out of my checking account on that date. I keep getting phone calls that I am delinquent on my payments. Well today I am shocked to learn I owe them an additional $326. This account has not decreased it keeps increasing and nobody from PNC has answers.  I am retired and living on a fixed income.  I am tired of their harassing phone calls and if I had funds I would sue them"
1705,1118,PNC Bank,"I worked for PNC bank and it was not the best experience.  The training was very demeaning, I was not given the tools to be successful but threatened daily about the lack of understanding."
1706,1118,PNC Bank,Terrible customer service lead to me closing all my accounts.
1707,1118,PNC Bank,"Have been banking with PNC for 13 years.  I had an business checking account and money market account.  Without any reason, they closed my accounts."
1708,1118,PNC Bank,The app sucks it take 4 whole days for everything to process and to go thru so I have to keep track of what I spend so having the application on my phone is of no use so don’t even he this bank it makes no sense unless you don’t use your debit card hardly
1709,1118,PNC Bank,Nick lions worst customer service rep ever.   Treated me with disrespect and was very condescending.  Told me to go to the branch.  I called because I work.   Erroneous fees charged by them to my account.
1710,1118,PNC Bank,The worst bank you can bank with is pnc. They steal from their clients and will manipulate dates to make it seem like you purchased an item at a different date.
1711,1118,PNC Bank,"PNC new lobby procedures is draconian at best. It's ridiculous! First your not allowed to go in until some one comes out and escorts you in and then they tell you where to stand even though there's markers on the floor showing you where to stand, then they tell which door to exit out of. Stupid!! You can go to the any store, any restaurant with no problems just wear a mask but you can't walk into a bank without being escorted in then bein told what to do when your in and then being told how to leave. This has nothing to do with safety and everything to do with social conditioning and social compliance without questions. Will not go back in the bank until common since takes over."
1712,1118,PNC Bank,"No action taken by the bank to dispute what was a mistaken online payment to a credit card company. I attempted to resolve 3 times but it was dismal waste of time, they didn't even try. Three identical cookie-cutter letters back. At the very least they could have tried writing something original rather refusing to help."
1713,1118,PNC Bank,"My job got phised and I got an email from my  boss telling me to buy gifts cards, ok messed up.  within 15 minutes of the transaction i realized that my job did not send it and the IT depart put out an alert that their systems were compromised. Filed police report, called the merchant and the bank.  It gets good here, called PNC (this was a friday) called PNC who told me I had to wait for the transaction to post and then file a dispute.  the transaction posted that Tuesday, i filed my dispute and waited, then without any contact with me PNC closed the dispute 2 times and told me it legitimate.  Now on Friday, it had no posted  I could have possibly stopped it but PNC said it had to post first. Now you all guessed it PNC is refusing to honor their 0 FRAUD LIABILITY.  I notified them before it went through and I was told it has to post first.   So much for PNC standing behind their customers.  i know a few people and we will be moving our money but PNC DISAPPOINTED ME"
1714,1118,PNC Bank,"On late 2016 I opened two accounts on 3320 S Congress Ave, Palm Springs, FL 33461 after a few months they offered me a credit card which I accepted, PNC points and later on PNC cash rewards. I started using PNC points for home expenses and PNC cash reward for work purchases, all my tools and materials, were paid weekly using cash rewards card and they were giving me peanuts  as a cash reward because it is a cash reward account. Week after week for months and my credit was improving, one day around September 2018 I didn’t use the card for the entire week because I was off that week, but my credit card continued accruing expenses like if I continued working that week( around $1800 dlls) (I use PNC online banking app) where I monitor in real time my expenses so you always know your daily and weekly expenses pending and posted transactions which reflected in the balance. Balance plus pending transactions  you always have control of your debt and know exactly how much you owe. Somehow they managed to use my previous transactions to which I believe they included in my weekly expenses to steal my money but I was in doubt so I said to myself maybe I was wrong and I owed more and accepted the fact. I continued my life like if nothing happened and about a few months around March 2019 my balance on my cash rewards was around $3500,00 and and my PNC points was about $2000,00 so that Sunday morning using my computer I logged in and made 2 payments $1500,00 to my PNC to my cash rewards card and $500,00 to my PNC points visa card so Monday morning Y was expecting my balance to be Cash rewards $2000,00 and my PNC points $1500, guess what, my PNC points visa card was reflecting  $1500,00 but my cash rewards was reflecting $2380 where did my $380 dollars go. So again a payment was showing that I paid $1500(in green numbers) but my balance was missing $380 so $1800 on September 2017 plus $380 on March 2019 please note that I had no pending transaction over $100,00 coming in that week. when I confronted them by phone and I was speaking with someone a clown voice in the background stated  (How did you know) At which I responded because I’m not stupid, I used PNC app online banking to track my expenses but they never credited the disputed amount stealing my money and did challenge me to prove it in a mocking way. I visited different local branches including the one where I originally opened my accounts and they refused to believe that this was happening, then I visited my closest branch from home  6535 Lake Worth Rd, Lake Worth, FL 33467 and the branch manager a woman Which surname is (Fifi) invited me to close my accounts instead of refunding my money. Again, I want people to know that this guys are vulgar rats, stealing my kids future. Nevertheless saying my interest rates increased to criminal 35% and every month I was paying almost $300 in interest charges for cash rewards and $90 for  PNC points and that’s not the worst, I paid them interest for over a year from money stolen from me. At this point in time I’m sure I was targeted by the bank administration to steal from me instead of profit from me, because when my credit was around 780 I asked for a loan to buy a mobile home for my family  an they declined twice one for a home and one for a dump truck. I just moved my money out of this racist people. I hope this helps other people to watch over their accounts closely and thanks for reading all the way here and please like and share so other people know. I believe they’re targeting Hispanics (Mexicans?) may they wanted to charge me for the Border Wall. Well they don’t want my business I just moved to another bank. So beware amigos!"
1715,1118,PNC Bank,"One star is way too generous! PNC deserves a zero! I have had nothing but problems since banking with PNC and it has only been a couple of months. Their employees are rude, nonchalant, and racist. I recently needed to visit a local branch to get some cash since I had not received my replacement card at the time. The branch lobby was closed and by appointment only, but I was unaware of that. I did not want to go through the drive thru since I was not driving. And you cannot use the cardless feature on the app at the ATM if you do not have a PNC bank card activated on your account. One of their elitist and nasty employees saw that I needed help and refused to assist me or even ask if I needed anything. I left because I did not want to end up getting shot for being Black or arrested for assault if I would have lost my temper! I contacted corporate and of course they apologized but it means nothing. These companies could not care less about Black people. How can any company say that Black Lives Matter when your entire executive board is filled with White people??? There are countless persons of color, including myself, that have college degrees and never even get considered for executive positions, so let's just keep it all the way real. The PNC phone and chat employees are also rude and incompetent. How can you not know about the products and services of the company you choose to work for??? This is why customer service is dead and a thing of the past. These companies make billions of dollars and they pay lower level employees chump change and they come to work miserable with the pay and their personal lives. What kind of s*!t is this??? Makes no sense whatsoever. I will be more than happy when I am done with PNC. I realize that all companies have problems of some sort, but it seems like many of these corporations are run by people who lack working brain cells and simple human decency. This can't be planet Earth sometimes I swear! Do yourself a favor and bank elsewhere. Preserve your mental and physical health and move on."
1716,1118,PNC Bank,Great customer service! I would like to give 5 stars to this bank.
1717,1118,PNC Bank,"Tried to purchase foreign currency from a local Chesapeake Virginia branch, and boy what a wake up call. I called over the phone to enquire about a certain amount but soon changed my mind and went for a lesser amount. When I went to the branch to order and pay they bought the higher amount after I instructed them that I wanted the lesser amount, I even wrote it on the order form. They deducted both purchases from my account. How does a bank do this? It took me several phone calls and as of right now, it is still not straight. I am now waiting for them to credit my account for the higher amount, DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THIS BANK. THEY ARE NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE!!!"
1718,1118,PNC Bank,"The customer service is always amazing. It was so easy for me to unlock my zelle account and get a new debit card mailed to me over the phone. I wish I remembered the lady's name who was helping me!!! She was so polite and professional and answered all my questions so thoroughly. My bf is always asking me why I would have a PNC bank account, and he heard my whole convo with the PNC employee and then he understood lol. Thanks so much!"
1719,1118,PNC Bank,"Had a random fee on my account.  Called the virtual wallet customer service line.  Conversation started off fine, after a couple minutes trying to understand the situation the rep kept cutting me off in the middle of my questions and answering with statements that were not even what I was asking.  Attempted to ask again and was interrupted again.  I had to ask her to not interrupt me and I was trying to understand the situation to prevent it happening again in the future.  (I honestly don't remember if I interupted her, but I know I was getting internally frustrated.) She sounded like she was getting really defensive because she could not answer my questions (I honestly don't believe she had the ability too, which isn't on her, that's on PNC) I really think if PNC can pull our recorded call, I think there would be a good learning opportunity for that rep/others.  They ended up refunding the fee as a one time situation.  I'm thankful for that and she seemed frustrated with me that I was trying to figure out why it happened, so it doesnt occur in the future.  The call was just frustrating.  I also work with customers over the phone for a living, so I can understand how annoying it can be when customers call in to just complain to get a fee waived.  I wanted to make the call more constructive and getting the fee waived was a bonus."
1720,1118,PNC Bank,"Worst service ever. I was emailed to contact them, so i call them up and they never picked up the phone. I waited and waited but no luck. Dontdo business with pnc bank they are just rip off. Or you will be waiting for hours to just talk to some one."

1724,1118,PNC Bank,Ketiurah was helpful in setting up overdraft protection for my personal account which was overdrawn due to no money in the account because of fraud which left a zero balance. She recommended a text alert system to acknowledge when the account is below $50.
